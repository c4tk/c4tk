<p>Ideate. Build. Impact.</p>
<p>Join us for a hackathon in Kirkland, WA, where you will spend the weekend creating technology that matters with like-minded people.</p>
<p>Developers, designers, entrepreneurs, creative individuals from all disciplines, investors, non-profits, and churches, will design and create new ways to tackle challenges confronting our society, our communities, and our lives from a Christian perspective.</p>
<h3 id="when">When</h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="what-to-bring">What to bring</h3>
<p>Bring your laptop and other things you need to be creative and productive. If you have an idea you&#39;d like to pitch, come with a 30 second elevator pitch. If you don&#39;t have an idea to pitch, you can work on your own, or join one of the many inspiring projects people are sharing.</p>
<h3 id="important-to-know">Important to know</h3>
<p>  C4TK is FREE this year! Having said that, if you RSVP, but decide not to come, let us know ASAP so we can plan for food accordingly.</p>
<p>The venue will remain open non-stop during the entire 24 hours. You can go home and rest or work through the night to make something awesome--whichever you prefer!</p>
<h4 id="-share-your-project-ideas-https-docs-google-com-spreadsheets-d-1-bpfqxgo845wph2p1ujvcusase-zv86ewdtkohkbh-u-edit-usp-sharing-"><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-BPfQXgO845wPH2p1ujVCUSASe-Zv86EWDTKoHkbH-U/edit?usp=sharing">Share Your Project Ideas</a></h4>
<p>We want to make this hackathon a success, particularly for people who spend the hackathon outside their technical comfort zone. So we are sharing <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-BPfQXgO845wPH2p1ujVCUSASe-Zv86EWDTKoHkbH-U/edit?usp=sharing">this spreadsheet</a> to help people get prepared in advance. For example, if someone plans to build a web app, they can explain what framework their using, tips for setting up a dev environment and tutorials so others can get familiar with the technology. Someone who typically works on a different framework can try it out to see if it&#39;s for them. We&#39;re hoping this will let people dive right in on hackathon day.</p>
<p>Parking is free.</p>

<p>The fourth Seattle Code for the Kingdom hackahton builds upon the success of the 2013, 2014 and 2016 Seattle Code for the Kingdom hackathons, as well as the 2015 Global hackathon and previous regional hackathons, which have already gathered over 3500 technologists to create over 330 projects to do good. This largest ever global faith-inspired tech collaboration will continue to activate technologists and other creative people to give their skills and some time as their contribution to the mission field, and it will also leverage the skills and in- sights of entrepreneurs, designers, and technologists to foster an entrepreneurial culture with Christian values.</p>
<p>Come, participate and address a number of challenges aimed at helping release the oppressed, teaching Godâs Word, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and supporting the church and the body of Christ. </p>
<p>Join us and letâs together create technology that matters.</p>

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">What&#x27;s a hackathon?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>A hackathon is an event where people get together and develop some awesome technologies in a short time span. Think of it as a creative marathon where at the end you have some product to show for.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">What is this hackathon trying to accomplish?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>This Hackathon is a non-profit event to encourage the activation and on-going collaboration of a larger ecosystem of all sort of creative individuals ( including programmers, designers, creatives, entrepreneurs, and leaders of churches, non-profits, and the marketplace) who are passionate about creating technologies to tackle from a Christian perspective the challenges confronting our society, our communities, our churches, and our spiritual lives.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">I&#x27;m not Christian. Can I still participate?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">What if I donât know how to program?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Everyone has something to offer to help transform lives. If you come full of ideas there will be technologists eager to be in a team with you.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Do I have to bring my own laptop?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes; we do not provide computers. Please bring anything youâll need to code.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">I canât stay the entire time, can I still participate?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes. We realize that 24 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments, or might prefer to work remotely, or need to go home/hotel to rest and shower. Yet, you need to be present for the initial few hours during the startup demos, and at some point you need be at the venue and do some work onsite. You will also need to be present for the final few hours for the presentations and judging.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Can I present a technology I already have?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>You can build on top of something you have, but whatever you present must have new code developed for at least one of the challenges of the hackathon and you must do some of that coding at the hackathon venue during the hackathon hours.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Wonât other teams who are building on top of technologies they already developed, not have an unfair advantage over me who plans to start coding during the actual hackathon hours?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>We donât think so. There will be separate awards for teams that present solutions built on their existing technologies, and for teams that start fresh at the hackathon. We want to honor all of you, regardless of whether you have been working for a while on something you are passionate about, or whether you decide on something brand new.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Do I have to work non-stop?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>No. The work space will be available non-stop entire durantion of the hackathon but it is up to you and your team to decide on your work schedule.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Will I be able to test my presentation before the final presentation?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes!</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Who will be in attendance at the final presentations?</span></div>
