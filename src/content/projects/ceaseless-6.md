Prayer shouldn't feel like a to-do list. Ceaseless is an app that shows you three contacts each day to pray for. You can add notes, send them a message or favorite the people most important to you. If 1% of the world's population had 130 unique friends and prayed for 3 people each day, we could personally pray for everyone on earth.

This is a longer description, just to see how it handles it. Does it overflow? Does it make the different boxes different in height? You get the idea.
