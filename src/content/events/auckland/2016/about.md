Join us for the 2016 Auckland Code for the Kingdom hackathon. Together with local organizers and partner organizations, we share a common vision to provide more opportunities for communities around the world to participate and showcase innovation and entrepreneurship in their communities. We unite to create technologies addressing significant issues confronting society, community, families, and spiritual life.

The first New Zealand Code for the Kingdom hackahton builds upon the success of previous hackathons, which have already gathered over 3000 technologists who have created hundreds of projects to do good. This Auckland collaboration will leverage the skills and insights of our entrepreneurs, designers, and technologists to foster an entrepreneurial culture with Christian values and activate technologists to give their skills and some time as their contribution to the mission field.

Come, participate and address a number of challenges aimed at helping release the oppressed, teaching God’s Word, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and supporting the church and the body of Christ. 

Join us and let’s together create technology that matters.
