Join us for the 2016 Poland Code for the Kingdom hackathon. Together with local organizers and partner organizations we share a common vision to provide more opportunities for communities around the world to participate and showcase innovation and entrepreneurship in their communities in creating technologies addressing significant issues confronting society, community, families, and spiritual life.

This first Poland Code for the Kingdom hackahton builds upon the success of the 2015 Global hackathon and previous regional hackathons, which have already gathered over 3000 technologists to create over 300 projects to do good. This largest ever global faith-inspired tech collaboration will continue to activate technologists and other creative people to give their skills and some time as their contribution to the mission field, and it will also leverage the skills and in- sights of entrepreneurs, designers, and technologists to foster an entrepreneurial culture with Christian values.

Come, participate and address a number of challenges aimed at helping release the oppressed, teaching God’s Word, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and supporting the church and the body of Christ. 

Join us and let’s together create technology that matters.
