Join us for the 2nd annual Rocky Mountain Hackathon. This time we’re going global! In partnership with Code for the Kingdom, Denver will be joining 13 other cities around the globe to rapidly create technology that will address real world problems.

As designers, developers, and technologists, we are uniquely gifted to contribute to the world around us through our digital talent. As followers of Jesus, we are compelled to love and live for others like He did. And at the Rocky Mountain Hackathon, we bring
 these two things together. Join us!

All food and drink will be provided. Lodging will also be available, if needed (beds are limited and first come, first serve). Whether you’re right up the road, or coming from Colorado Springs or Boulder, we’ll take care of you for the whole weekend!

Sponsors, challenges, prizes, and speakers will be announced soon. Check back on this page or the Eventbrite page for updated information
