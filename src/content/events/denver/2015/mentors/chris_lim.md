<p>
Christopher Lim is founder of TheoTech, a company activating a movement of Technology Entrepreneurship for the Gospel. This means beginning with God as the Customer and working backwards to create the things He desires to see in the world.
</p>
As a practitioner, Chris is focused on Ceaseless, a technology-supported movement to personally pray for everyone on earth. He is also developing a system to help churches reflect the multilingual glory of God's kingdom by subtitling messages in real time so that congregations no longer need to be segregated by language.

He is available as a mentor for:

* Ideation & Pitching
* Full stack web development (Java, NodeJS+Express, AngularJS, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, ...)
* Mobile app development (iOS, Ionic Framework)
* Artificial Intelligence (machine learning, natural language processing, machine translation, automatic speech recognition, ...)
