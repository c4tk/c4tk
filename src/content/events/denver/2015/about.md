###What is Code for the Kingdom?

Are you a coder, developer, designer, or technologist? Have you ever wanted to solve problems that you see in your own city or community, or around the world? If so, join us November 6-8, 2015 for Code for the Kingdom’s first hackathon in Colorado.

Code for the Kingdom is a weekend Hackathon series and ongoing ecosystem where the challenges confronting our communities, society, families, and spiritual lives are tackled from a Christian perspective. Simply put, a hackathon is a 48 hour “hacking” marathon where coders, developers, designers, ideators and others come together to collaborate and serve God’s Kingdom using technology.

Code for the Kingdom’s previous regional and global events have already gathered over 2000 technologists to design and create over 250 new projects and solutions to real world problems. And now is your chance to join the movement. Together, let’s create technology to help release the oppressed, teach God’s word, empower the global expansion of the church, and offer hope to those in need.
