This app project is intended to become a tool to the small groups, church leaders, and groups of friends and family to organize prayer walking in their neighborhoods. 

The simple outreach lifestyle movement, “Prayer, Care, Share”, encourages a lifestyle for all believers that has three simple elements: Active PRAYER for the people around you, looking for tangible ways to show CARE for the people around you, and being ready to SHARE with the people around you. 

Faith communities commit to prayer for their neighborhood, both from their homes and churches, but also by walking in those neighborhoods and praying. This simple idea of prayer walking is something that happens globally. 

What if there was an app that you could track your prayer walking route like jogging and hiking routes do?

What if your prayer walking routes could be shared to your faith community where others are sharing their prayer walking routes? 
What if the church leadership used this to cover every street in their community with prayer? What would happen in their communities for Christ?

How could you create a social components to the experience of prayer walking?

A few key feature of the app would need to be:
The ability to track your walking path
The ability to save that walk
The ability to share that walk and add it to a shared community page.
The ability to challenge friends to join you
Offer challenges to your friends to cover sections of the city
Offer a way for people to share a thought with the Geo location
