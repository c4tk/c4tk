Lumi provides Rent-to-Own (RTO) solar power systems (also known as Pay-As-You-Go Solar) to low-income families living without electricity in Africa.  By changing the business model to small payments over time with  a rent-to-own system, Lumi turns an expensive, often cost-prohibitive asset purchase into affordable electricity access.  Shifting away from kerosene and other fossil fuels to RTO solar for energy saves money, reduces health and safety hazards, and improves education and quality of life for Lumi’s customers.  Lumi's sales process and ongoing customer relationship also provide a ready-made platform for ministry.

#### Challenge Overview:
In order to reach more and more people and do so effectively, Lumi needs to design hardware devices and supporting software better suited for the people who use them: the rural African villager who has never used a computer, may have only completed a 3rd grade education and yet has a mobile phone.
<br>
How can Lumi's devices be improved to be more attractive to customers by providing more value and better features?  How can Lumi add functionality to its software to communicate more effectively with customers and virally expand it's reach to more customers?
<br>
#### Challenge Details:
##### Hardware
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon fa-sun-o"></i>Lumi's flagship product is a small device provides light, USB charging (phones or anything running off 5V) and a radio.
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon fa-sun-o"></i>What functionality or features could Lumi add that use the existing components?  Example: play mp3 files from a USB drive, deliver media via the transfer process.
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon fa-sun-o"></i>How could Lumi change the "hockey puck" design to something more appealing and/or functional?  Example: more functional shape, more exciting colors, customization (i.e local 3D printer).
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon fa-sun-o"></i>Could the device provide more feedback to the customers via the existing LED indicators and/or a small LCD?
<br>
<br>
##### Hardware / Software Intersection: the Rent-to-Own system
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon fa-sun-o"></i>Lumi's current system activates the device (or adds "credit") via bluetooth using a smartphone app operated by Lumi "Agents" who have storefronts, kiosks, etc. in markets near where customers work and live.  The credit is solely based on time and when the time expires the device deactivates until the customer buys more credit.
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon fa-sun-o"></i>In the past Lumi has used a scratch card and sms system which proved too costly and cumbersome for both customers and Lumi.  Lumi opted to migrate to the bluetooth system but still challenges remain - it's more centralized, dependent upon network connectivity, still no telemetry, etc.
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon fa-sun-o"></i>What other activation methods could be used?  Or how could the bluetooth system be improved to be more efficient, effective, etc.?  Example: add a wifi chip, offline functionality for the bluetooth app, etc.
<br>
<br>
##### Software
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon fa-sun-o"></i>Lumi's Agent mobile app has enormous potential and currently functions for the rent-to-own system but is not effective for collection information from customers, communicating with Lumi or disseminating information to customers.
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon fa-sun-o"></i>Nearly all of Lumi's customers have a phone, but not a smartphone, and so are limited to voice and sms.
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon fa-sun-o"></i>Lumi is implementing CRM and Call Center software to better serve our customers (hopefully to be at least functional by the hackathon).
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon fa-sun-o"></i>How can Lumi use sms to more efficiently and effectively communicate with customers?  Example: build or implement an app that receives customer sms for support, feedback, etc. and integrates with CRM and Call Center software.
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon fa-sun-o"></i>Lumi customers are our best advocates and salespeople.  How can Lumi incentivize and systematically track customer referrals?  Example: sms-based system for tracking referrals and rewards, agent app feature for monitoring customer referrals
