At Church Community Builder, we’ve always designed our Church Management Software with church leaders in mind. Our goal is to equip church leaders and volunteers with the tools they need to do ministry, and that seeps into every corner of the software. Your church is full of dedicated leaders and volunteers who fill vital roles that keep your ministry thriving. We’re here to support them.

The Church Community Builder software is actively being used by approximately 4,000 churches in the United States. So many of the individuals who attend our churches have strengths and skill sets to offer to the community, but don't have a way of understanding the needs of their community. 

This app, or mobile responsive site, is intended to solve this problem. Your challenge is to form a team and build an app that can aggregate needed services (mechanic, plummer, accountant) of those in need (single parents, low-income families, etc.) in every community our software exists and match those needs to those in the community willing to fill them.

Refer to the API section of the website for access to the sandbox.
