How can we ensure everyone on earth can safely access the Bible in their own language, even in the most remote and hostile corners of the world?

DESCRIPTION: 
How can we ensure everyone on earth can safely access the Bible in their own language, even in the most remote and hostile corners of the world?
As Christians we are called to bring the hope of the Gospel to every person on the planet and as Paul demonstrated in 1 Corinthians 9:19-23, we ought to present the Gospel to people in light of their technological needs and preferences.

How can we meet them where they are at with the technologies, media, and format that are relevant to them? How do we serve people in lower-technology settings, using different social platforms, dwelling in different cultures, and living in hostile situations?

How can we ensure the Scriptures are available in every medium from mobile & web apps, to social media and messaging platforms, to basic SMS, etc.? What new technology can you invent to make Scripture Engagement go viral?

How can we help people groups across the countries find the Bible in their heart language, the language their mothers spoke to them in, the language they pray in, across different platforms? Could you a create social awareness campaign for the Bible (leveraging the Digital Bible Platform API) to share the Good News in your country on the relevant social media platforms?

How can technology help ethnic minority Christians living in hostile environments reach their non-Christian neighbors? How can it empower & encourage them to make disciples? How can it help protect minorities from persecution while creating safe places for Muslims to engage with the Gospel?

How can technology help missional communities share the best resources that help them share Jesus with others in their community? Could you create a slack integration that enables people to share and review resources?
