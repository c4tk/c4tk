At the core of the human trafficking issue is supply and demand. Where there is demand, there is an industry working to create the supply. It is also a reality that the quicker and easier it is purchase something, the more likely a buyer will risk an impulse purchase. This is true in selling sex online. The growth of the online and mobile marketplace for sex fuels the supply of trafficked girls. 

Technology has become the predominant tool of sex traffickers. The ease by which they can acquire mobile phones and new numbers, allows the traffickers to coordinate meeting points, terms of the transaction, and to maintain communication with the victims and the “johns”. Escort websites and online classified ad sites provide the traffickers with countless opportunities to conduct their businesses and publish those mobile numbers. 

But what if you were to create technology that would take the very same information traffickers advertise, and use it to disrupt their business? 

In Dallas this year, a team of developers decided to disrupt those recruiting girls to be trafficked, but overwhelming their hashtags with posts. The solutions was called #Ihaveaname

What can be done for other platforms? What else can we do to frustrate this dark industry?
