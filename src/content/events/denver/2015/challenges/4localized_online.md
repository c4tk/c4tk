Problem #1: Online evangelism and outreach is no longer new. Whereas, it has great potential and statistically shows the world is full of people spiritual seekers online, it is facing the next great stage in growth: making offline disciples. All online outreach efforts, many of whom are very sophisticated, are facing the same problem with creating genuine, lasting offline disciples. 

What if the problem with current online outreach is that we are thinking too global? 

Currently, most major online outreach efforts lack a nearby faith community behind them. The resources are great, the ministries driving them are great, but they are often hosted great distances away and staffed by people available to meet in person. 

What if we the new phase of global online outreach is local? Small groups, churches, or even groups of friends using online to connect with the place they live, connecting with seekers, and having the ready opportunity for offline connection?

What if we built an online outreach for the front range of Colorado specifically?
Some topics are common to everyone seeking, but what questions or thoughts are specifically front range?

Using the Codex online e-coaching platform, we want to launch at the hackthon a beta platform for these spiritual conversations? One we plan to deploy in the next few months.

The Codex platform has years of success in Europe with the Jesus.net movement. The platform is developed with engagement and e-coaching at the heart, allowing deeper, personal conversations than are often possible in other social forums. 
How do we introduce Colorado people to Jesus in ways that make sense to them?

What groups are in Colorado that would be the right kind of places to offer spiritual seekers an offline experience? Meetup.com or Alpha Course style? Places ready to have conversations with people honestly “unconvinced” and even “religion-phobic”, but who at the same time can’t let the conversation go, and want to understand something more?

This challenge is for online marketers, communicators, writers, designers, and anyone with an understanding for bringing the gospel into this unique location.
