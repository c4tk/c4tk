intro: The Translate Assistant
---

The Translate Assistant project built upon a unique linguistic method pioneered by [The Bible Translator's Assistant](http://www.thebibletranslatorsassistant.org). The team created a web app that enables people without advanced linguistic education to contribute to Bible translation. The web app presents the text of the Bible and allows the user to specify the precise meaning of every sentence. With this information, The Bible Translator's Assistant can automatically generate initial draft translations using linguistic rules customized for a particular language. The Bible Translator's Assistant is currently helping produce accurate and natural translations of the Bible in the Philippines and additional languages are scheduled to be added in Vanuatu.

Championed by Matthew Rodatus and built by Matthew Rodatus, Jason Ardell, Nick Sackman, Erica Gonnerman, and Brianna Thorsen
