title: Best Use of the Church Community Builder API
intro: Neighborly
---
This app was completed as a fully functioning needs sharing app where one community member could post a need and another community member could respond to that need, and it was build with full integration to the Church Community Builder platform.

The app came from the CCB team, championed by Brian Ferris (CCB) and built by Isaac Lewis, Howard Pflugh, Patrick McKay, Keiichi Lindley, and Abbas Angouti.
