intro: Outside of the Library Box
--- 

The Project was to simplify the Media Library Box UI for oral learners making it more graphical and less dependent on textual content for a cleaner user experience.

The Media Library Box is a self-contained, self-powered WiFi based portable media distribution system.  It allows users to create a full featured ‘digital library’ from which Gospel/Educational media (text, video, audio, webpages, applications) can be shared to mobile phones, tablets, laptops, desktops in an off-the grid environment without depending on access to the internet or electricity.  Any device with WiFi capability can wirelessly connect to the Media Library Box and access/download content with a simple web browser.  The Media Library Box will support over 30 simultaneous browsing/download sessions from different devices with contextual menu's based on the users browser language setting.
