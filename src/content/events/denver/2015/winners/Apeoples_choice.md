intro: Lifeline
---
An app for disrupting Human Trafficking. The Lifeline application is designed for a user driven community (a mobile neighborhood watch) to report threatening occurrences in communities such as a pimp or trafficker trying to recruit a minor, gang activity, violent crimes against others.  People would be able to see what kind of activity reported by others is going on in their area.

Championed by Adrienne Livingston (WorldVenture) and built by Athan Clark, Jeffrey Josol, Robert Glover, and Michael Gurney.
