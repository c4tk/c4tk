        </header>
        <p>What can you create that will help alleviate the rampant social oppression of our day? Let’s create technologies to provide disaster relief, community development, medical & health assistance, and seek justice in illegal, immoral, and dangerous cases.

        </header>
        <p>Every person has the right to receive God’s Word and discover His unconditional love. Let's build new technologies to form relationships with non-believers, seek decisions to follow Christ, and translate Scripture and Christian resources.

        </header>
        <p>Followers of Christ are called to lives of generous sacrifice, extending beyond simple financial generosity, to include generosity of our mind, time and possessions. Let’s create technology to encourage individuals and families to become generous in every aspect of their lives.</p>

        <p>Every person has something unique to contribute to the community, society, and church. What technologies can you create to disciple new believers, prepare national Christians to become missionaries, and help national churches and groups engage in cross-cultural missions?</p>
