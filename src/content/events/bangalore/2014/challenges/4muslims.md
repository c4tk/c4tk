How can you help Muslims learn about Christ? While many Muslims are interested in learning more about Christ, most of them do not want their family and friends to know. Fear of others and security are very real issues to a Muslim engaging the Gospel. However, being a very relational culture, Muslims make decisions in the context of community.

How can technology, films, and games help Muslims engage with the Gospel in the context of community, while protecting their identity for security?

How can you help the 13 million ethnic Christians in the Middle East reach their Muslim neighbors? How can you encourage them, disciple them, and help them reach their own nations?
