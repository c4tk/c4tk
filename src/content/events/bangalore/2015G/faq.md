    Pivoting, what is this CrossPlan that I hear about?

CrossPlan will be bringing Indian and international angel investors, incubators and accelerators to help nurture and nourish new business ideas and existing ventures that will glorify God and serve the Kingdom. YCL (www.youngcreativeleaders.com) is honored to collaborate with Code for the Kingdom and the Hackathon weekend to present CrossPlan from 6 - 8pm on Fri Oct 2 at Fairfield Marriott, Bengaluru.

    What is the format of CrossPlan?
  answer:
    CrossPlan really kicks off when passionate believers who have a new business idea or an existing business venture submit their concept for review at www.c4tk.in/crossplan. All entries will be considered and shortlisted to the top 10 winners (5 new business ideas and 5 existing business ventures) who will then be invited to present their concepts in person at CrossPlan. This in person finals will be held at 6 - 8pm on Fri Oct 4 where these top 10 winners will pitch their ideas/ventures to a group of Christian angel investors, incubators, accelerators and a community of technologists and entrepreneurs.
- question:
    That’s new! Who is this event really for?
  answer:
    This event is really for Christian entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial Christians! We’d like to honor Christian entrepreneurs who have taken a stance to solve a problem or challenge in the Kingdom and have an existing venture that is serving people or the Kingdom. So if you have an existing venture, company or non-profit that is glorifying God in some way or created for that purpose, please log onto www.c4tk.in/crossplan to get started.
- question:
    Is CrossPlan only for entrepreneurs and business minded people?
  answer:
    No. We also want to encourage entrepreneurial Christians who have always wanted to start/do something for the Kingdom and make an impact in the community with your God given skills and talents. Hence, this opportunity is open to musicians, teachers, social workers and every kind of entrepreneurial Christian who wants to do something good. So even if it’s just a business idea or a working prototype or even a beta project, please get started on www.c4tk.in/crossplan.
- question:
    What prizes are in store for participants of CrossPlan?
  answer:
    Regardless of whether you have a new business idea or an existing venture, you stand to win seed capital upto Rs. 1, 50, 000 in cash prizes, mentoring, incubation space, infrastructure etc. and much more. If you have any questions about your eligibility, please send an email to code@c4tk.in and write to us to get instant clarification.
- question:
    I’m game. How much does it cost to participate in CrossPlan?
  answer:
    Zero. Zilch. Zip. Nada. Nothing. You don’t have to pay anything to participate in CrossPlan. What’s more, you could win seed capital upto Rs. 1, 50, 000 in cash prizes and much more in terms of mentoring, funding and support! Wait, you’re still reading this? You should be heading over to www.c4tk.in/crossplan and submitting your idea/venture for consideration. \#Justdoit.
- question:
    It’s FREE??? What is the application process?
  answer:
    Yes. It’’s absolutely free to participate in CrossPlan. Simply go to www.c4tk.in/crossplan to submit your business concept and get started. There are two categories - New Business Idea and Existing Business Venture. Please select an appropriate category and submit your application for review.
- question:
   Will someone steal my business idea if I pitch it publically in its nascent stage?
  answer:
    “The value of an idea lies in using it”. - Thomas Edison. Remember, no one became successful merely because they had a great idea. The reward (and risk) lies in execution. That said, C4TK or any partnering organization WILL NOT use any of your pitched idea(s) and run a business with it. On the contrary, we want to help you connect with those who can invest, support and guide you to translating those ideas to reality.
- question:
    Are only Christian concepts entertained or accepted?
  answer:
    No. Our goal is to serve Christian entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial Christians and help them reach their goals faster. We welcome either Christian ideas and ventures or ideas and ventures founded by Christians. So even if your venture is a regular business idea that doesn’t have a direct Christian connection, please go ahead and submit your concept on www.c4tk.in/crossplan.
- question:
    Which category of CrossPlan does my idea/venture fit into?
  answer:
    CrossPlan exists to honor both new and existing business ideas/ventures that glorify God and serve the Kingdom. If you have an existing offering that has been serving people as of Aug 10 2015, it is an existing business venture. If not, we consider your venture to still be in the “idea” phase and reckon it is a new business idea. If you have any questions about your eligibility, please send an email to code@c4tk.in and write to us to get instant clarification.
- question:
    How many applications can I submit for CrossPlan?
  answer:
    Unlimited! You can submit applications for as many ideas and/or ventures in the two CrossPlan categories - New Business Idea and Existing Business Venture. Please note that each idea/venture requires only one submission. However, please make sure that you don’t submit multiple applications for the same idea/venture. Multiple submissions for the same idea/venture do not offer any additional benefit for you and it only makes our job harder as we try to delete the duplicate submissions.
- question:
    What if I have a team working on my business idea/venture?
  answer:
    The more, the merrier! It doesn’t matter how many of you are working on your idea/venture. Anyone can submit an application on behalf of your idea/venture. In fact, you can submit an application on behalf of a friend’s idea/venture as well. So be generous and help a budding entrepreneurial friend by getting his/her business concept submitted on www.c4tk.in/crossplan.
- question:
    Let me get started then! What happens to those who are selected?
  answer:
    While we are thankful for all the entries, we can afford to shortlist only the Top 10 Winners. We will then invite these Top 10 Winners (five (5) new business ideas and five (5) existing business ventures) to the weekend Hackathon on Oct 2-4 2015 in Bengaluru. These Top 10 Winners will then get a chance to pitch their ideas/ventures to a group of Christian angel investors, incubators, accelerators and a community of technologists and entrepreneurs. One winner and runner-up from each category will then be awarded seed capital of upto Rs. 1, 50, 000 in cash prizes and much more in terms of mentoring, funding and support.
- question: 
     What happens to the Top 10 Winners who don’t go on to win cash prizes?
  answer:
    Unfortunately, no. However, all the top 10 winners will get a chance to connect with the large digital community at the venue comprising angel investors, technologists and entrepreneurs who might be able to support these ideas/ventures further. In fact, we will ensure that each of the Top 10 Winners are connected to at least one mentor/ organization to guide the idea/venture forward.
- question:
    Oh! What about those who apply but are not selected?
  answer:
    In the Kingdom, we believe that no effort should go unrewarded as said in Luke 10:7 - “A laborer is worth his wages”. For those who applied but were not selected, we’d love to invite you to join us on Friday Oct 2 for the kickoff from 2 - 10pm. We’d love to have dinner with you and know you better while we hear the opening keynote, watch CrossPlan and hear our hackathon pitches. However, this invitation is not open by default to all applicants as there are limited seats available for that evening. If you applied and did not get selected but still want to attend the kick off evening, please write to us at code@c4tk.in to request a Kickoff Pass for yourself.
- question:
    Sounds fair. Can I attend CrossPlan without attending the Hackathon and vice versa?
  answer:
    FYI, while the \#C4TK Hackathon runs from 12noon IST on Fri Oct 2 till 6pm IST on Sun Oct 4, CrossPlan is a two hour program that runs from 6pm to 8pm IST on Fri Oct 2. If you apply for participating in the Hackathon and are selected, yes, you can attend the Hackathon without attending CrossPlan. If you apply for participating in CrossPlan and are selected as one of the Top 10 Winners, yes, you can attend CrossPlan without attending the Hackathon.
- question:
     How can I get the latest updates about the event?

    Wait, I’m not based in Bengaluru. Can I still attend?

- question:
    In case I’m not a technologist, entrepreneur or designer, can I still attend?

    While the last day for submission is Tue Sep 10 2015, we strongly recommend you to apply as soon as possible as applications are rolling and seats could fill up soon. So rush to www.c4tk.in/crossplan and send in your submissions as soon as you can.
- question:
    Awesome. What is the next step after submission?
  answer:
    On submission, you will receive a confirmation email along with suggested next steps. Please ensure that you submit your application before Sep 10 2015. While the official announcements for the top 10 shortlisted entries will be made on Sep 14 2015, we will try and respond personally on an earlier date if possible.

- question:
    What happens to the shortlisted Top 10 Winners?
  answer:
    All shortlisted Top 10 Winners will be invited to attend the \#C4TK Hackathon weekend at the Fairfield Marriott in Bengaluru and the entry fee of Rs. 2,000 will be waived for them. They will then get a chance to pitch their ideas/ventures to Christian angel investors on Friday evening on Oct 2 from 6 - 8pm in front of the whole community of \#C4TK attendees. One winnner and one runner-up in each category (new business idea and existing business venture) will be awarded prizes on Sunday evening on Oct 4.
- question:
    That’s like Shark Tank! How many projects will be shortlisted for the next round?
  answer:
    That’s right. It is like Shark Tank, but angels are nothing like Sharks. Sharks are aggressive and they bite. Angels are gentle and they guide you instead. That said, we will accept all the applications and then shortlist 10 Top Winners who will be invited to attend CrossPlan at the Hackathon weekend.
- question:
    What’s in store for those who get shortlisted?
  answer:
    All those who get shortlisted will get detailed emails about next steps in a timely manner latest by or before Sep 14 2015. If you think you haven’t received any emails by error, please contact us at code@c4tk.in.
- question:
    What about those who did not get shortlisted?
  answer:
    In the Kingdom, we believe that no effort should go unrewarded as said in Luke 10:7 - “A laborer is worth his wages”. For those who do not get shortlisted, we’d love to invite you to join us on Friday evening on Oct 2 for the kickoff from 5-9pm. We’d love to have dinner with you and know you better while we hear the opening keynote, watch CrossPlan and hear our hackathon pitches.However, this invitation is not open by default to all applicants as there are limited seats available for that evening. If you applied and did not get selected but still want to attend the kick off evening, please write to us at code@c4tk.in to request a Kickoff Pass for yourself.
- question:
     Hmmm… So for those who are shortlisted, how and what can they prepare for?
  answer:
     If you got shortlisted as one of the Top 10 Winners, first of all congratulations! Along with your confirmation email, you will receive a PDF file that confirms everything step by step. If you got the confirmation email but not the PDF file, please mail code@c4tk.in to request that copy again. Regardless, we will be in touch in person and ensure you are all set. If you do not get shortlisted, please refer to the previous question and answer how you can still benefit from this opportunity.
- question:
     OK. What if I already paid for the Hackathon and then got selected for CrossPlan?
  answer:
     Never fear! If you get selected for CrossPlan and have already paid for the Hackathon, we will instantly refund your Hackathon payment. As a Top 10 Winner, if you’ve already paid for the Hackathon, you will also have the option to forfeit the refund and instead bring a companion to the event. As soon as the results are announced, we will be in touch to help you plan this out smoothly.

- question:
    Whaaaa??? That’s awesome. How will prizes be shared among team members?
  answer:
    We know you’re big boys and can figure this on your own. Code For The Kingdom and YCL are here only to facilitate this digital commission and will not interfere in how each team decides to share the spoils. When the winners are announced on Sunday at 4pm, they will be asked to confirm how to divide the cash and other prizes amongst the team members.
- question:
    Cool! Who will be on the jury?
  answer:
    The jury will be a six member panel comprising Indian and international Christian investors, technologists, entrepreneurs and ministry heads. Last year’s \#C4TK Bengaluru Hackathon had a similar mix and we will confirm this year’s judging line up on Sep 25 2015. If you feel equipped to judge this competition or would like to recommend a potential judge, please write to code@c4tk.in and tell us rightaway. Thank you so much!

    What are the judging criteria for the Hackathon and CrossPlan?
