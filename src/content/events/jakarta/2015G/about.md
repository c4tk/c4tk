Code for the Kingdom, a Leadership Network hackathon initiative, convenes bright entrepreneurs and technologists to use their gifts to affect global culture from a Christian perspective. It seeks to advance the Gospel through the creation of new technologies addressing significant issues confronting society, community, families, and spiritual life.

In 2015, we are expanding Code for the Kingdom to include a Global Hackathon Weekend to host events in 15 locations simultaneously. 

Together our vision is to provide more opportunities for communities around the world to participate and showcase innovation and entrepreneurship in their communities. We expect over 1,000 people to participate and address a number of challenges aimed at helping release the oppressed, teaching Godâ€™s Word, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and supporting the church and the body of Christ.

#God doesn't call the qualified. He qualifies the called.

Whom God calls, He qualifies - and He chooses everybody to do something specific, something that is part of His design. He chooses each of us to do something for Him despite our past failures, limitations, and inadequacies. Because we know that we're chosen, because we've heard God call our names, we can help others hear God call their names.
