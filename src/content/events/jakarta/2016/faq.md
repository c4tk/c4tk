- question:

- question:

- question:
    What is this hackathon trying to accomplish?
  answer:
    This Hackathon is a non-profit event to encourage the activation and on-going collaboration of a larger ecosystem of all sort of creative individuals ( including programmers, designers, creatives, entrepreneurs, and leaders of churches, non-profits, and the marketplace) who are passionate about creating technologies to tackle from a Christian perspective the challenges confronting our society, our communities, our churches, and our spiritual lives.
- question:
    I'm not Christian. Can I still participate?
  answer:
    Yes, absolutely. 
- question:
    What if I don’t know how to program?
  answer:
    Everyone has something to offer to help transform lives. If you come full of ideas there will be technologists eager to be in a team with you.
- question:
    Do I have to bring my own laptop?   
  answer:
    Yes; we do not provide computers. Please bring anything you’ll need to code.  
- question:
    I can’t stay the entire time, can I still participate?   
  answer:
    Yes. We realize that 47 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments, or might prefer to work remotely, or need to go home/hotel to rest and shower. Yet, you need to be present for the initial few hours during the startup demos, and at some point you need be at the venue and do some work onsite. You will also need to be present for the final few hours for the presentations and judging.   
- question:
    Can I present a technology I already have?
  answer:
    You can build on top of something you have, but whatever you present must have new code developed for at least one of the challenges of the hackathon and you must do some of that coding at the hackathon venue during the hackathon hours.
- question:
    Won’t other teams who are building on top of technologies they already developed, not have an unfair advantage over me who plans to start coding during the actual hackathon hours?   
  answer:
    We don’t think so. There will be separate awards for teams that present solutions built on their existing technologies, and for teams that start fresh at the hackathon. We want to honor all of you, regardless of whether you have been working for a while on something you are passionate about, or whether you decide on something brand new.
- question:
    Do I have to work non-stop?
  answer:
    No. The work space will be available non-stop entire durantion of the hackathon but it is up to you and your team to decide on your work schedule.
- question:
    Will I be able to test my presentation before the final presentation?   
  answer:
    Yes!
- question:
    Who will be in attendance at the final presentations?   
  answer:
    The final screening is public, although space is limited. Expect a mixture of participants, hi-tech executives, venture capitalists and angels, ministry and non-profit leaders, press, and observers.
- question:
    What's the hashtag?   
  answer:
    \#C4TK 
- question:
