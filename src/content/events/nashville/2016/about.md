###What is Code for the Kingdom?

Are you an entrepreneur, technologist or innovator? Have you ever wanted to impact your cities, circles and communities and solve problems that you see around you? Have you ever wanted to be the change? If yes, join us on March 11-13, 2016 for the Nashville's first ever Code for the Kingdom Hackathon.

Code for the Kingdom is a weekend Hackathon series and ongoing ecosystem where the challenges confronting our communities, our society, our families, and our spiritual lives are tackled from a Christian perspective. The movement hosts weekend gatherings in different cities where developers, designers, ideators and others collaborate to advance common good and serve God’s Kingdom.

This first Code for the Kingdom in the Tennessee builds upon the success of previous hackathons, which have already gathered thousands of technologists to create hundreds of projects to do good. This Nashville collaboration will leverage the skills and insights of our entrepreneurs, designers, and technologists to foster an entrepreneurial culture with Christian values and activate technologists to give their skills and some time as their contribution to the mission field.

Join some of the most talented developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and creative people in the country as they collaborate with each other to create innovative technology. All of these groups will also work with investors, mentors, innovative non-profits and churches to come up with ideas and projects to help release the oppressed, teach God’s word, heal the sick, feed the hungry, clothe the naked and support the Church and the body of Christ.  

Join us this March 11-13 and let’s create technology that matters.
