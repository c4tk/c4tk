intro: Slackin' Church 
---
Bring Christianity and spiritual dynamics into Slack. [Slackin' Church](http://slackin.church/slackinchurch) is a powerful add-on for church communities. Slack itself is already the best tool for team-based communities and communication. Slack + Slackin' Church will make for a wonderful community experience.

Look up any single Bible passage, or multiple passages, using bible: John 3:16; Genesis 1:1 (separate with semi-colons)
Intelligently parses Bible verses using common abbreviations so that bible: 1 Cor 13:4-7 also works.
Participate in collaborative Bible studies.
With Slackin' Church you can Participate in collaborative Bible studies. Churches can offer Bible-in-Slack to read Scripture together during the sermon portion of a worship service. When the pastor says, "Turn with me to BOOK CHAPTER:VERSE," one person types it in, and the whole congregations is already there. Finally, a Bible lookup that is faster than a physical Bible and any app out there (today, I still flip through my Bible to a particular passage than I can with the YouVersion Bible app).
Or you can share prayer requests, manage and keep track of prayer requests for your small group or accountability groups right in Slack.
