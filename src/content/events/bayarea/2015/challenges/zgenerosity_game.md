Knowing that generosity brings about spiritual growth and that generosity is a like a muscle (the sooner they start exercising it the stronger the person will become), how can technology help children become generous? What if games could simulate the personal, familiar, and communal growth or decline that comes with being generous of mind, time, love, and resources? And could a game show the eventual decline when generosity is not exercised?

How could games be used creatively to teach children about generosity?
