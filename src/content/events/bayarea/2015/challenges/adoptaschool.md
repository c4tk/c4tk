Transforming the Bay with Christ is leading a coalition of business leaders, venture capitalists, pastors, and non-profit leaders, to activate a grass roots movement that will transform the Bay Area through social compassion and service.Â One of the initiatives that TBC is fostering is the adoption of each school in the Bay Area by a church, a non-profit, or a business with the intention of serving as a champion that would voice and help meet the need of the adopted school.

You can create technology to help this vision become a reality. Your creation could map and help identify schools that are not yet adopted. It could also map the level and frequency of engagement that the adopting organization is giving on an ongoing basis to foster the relationship with the school and met the need.  It is not enough to mark a school as adopted; adopting is just the beginning of a growth journey towards health and excellence.

Likewise, you can create technology to activate other parts of the TBC movement to collaborate with the adopting organization to meet the need of the school.  And so much more.
