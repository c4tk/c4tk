          <h3>Social Justice - extend grace </h3>
        </header>
        <p>How will you knock off a little corner of darkness in the world? What technologies can you create that will alleviate the social maladies that oppress so many? Work with non-profits to help rescue victims of human trafficking, combat poverty, lift the fatherless, release the oppressed, heal the sick and feed the hungry. Use your skills to create a brighter world and lift up your community. What technologies can you create to affect the life of one lost child in your own neighborhood?

          <h3>Spiritual Justice</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Every person has the right to receive God’s Word and discover His unconditional love, because only God’s truth has the ability to transform the heart and the mind. Join forces with other like minded individuals and create technologies that help reduce spiritual poverty in every nation, city, community, family, and individual.
        Build mobile applications to help children learn the Word of God, bury it in their hearts and share it with their friends. Create technologies for prayer, evangelism, mentorship, and other innovative means to spiritual formation.</p>

          <h3>Help Create a culture of Generosity</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The Follower of Christ is called to a life of generous sacrifice extending beyond simple financial generosity, to include generosity of our mind, time and possessions. Create technology to encourage individuals and families to become generous in every aspect of their lives.</p>

          <h3>Releasing our best</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Every person has something unique to contribute to the community, society, and church. Yet, less than 20% of us are actively engaged in doing what we could do. Most of us do not understand how we can leverage our skills and ideas to improve the lives of others.
         Build technologies to mobilize and equip every member of your community, church and family. Empower them to release their skills as well as to accelerate great ideas and initiatives that could transform the lives of the child or adult down your street.</p>
