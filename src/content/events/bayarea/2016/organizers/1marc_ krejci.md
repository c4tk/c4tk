Marc Krejci came up through the music industry, tripped over entrepreneurship, and became a pastor after establishing himself in the world of technology.

Passionate about making the invisible, visible; and the impossible seem possible, he finds joy serving the one true King, pursuing epic outdoor adventures, and developing ecosystems of innovation.

Recently he and his family finished their eleven-year chapter in Nashville and moved to Silicon Valley where he joined Venture Christian Church as their newly formed Pastor of Innovation.
