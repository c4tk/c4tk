Chris was part of a winning team in the first ever Code for the Kingdom. That event opened opportunities for other contributions in kingdom related projects. He was the technical lead for the companion app to Francis Chan's "You and Me Forever" book. For his day job, Chris works as a developer at OpenGov, helping governments be more accountable and make better financial decisions.
