What if there were no barriers to how people in the Bay Area could participate in missions and service opportunities? 
We are not talking just of a way for churches to list their activities for other churches to know about but a way by which individuals, regardless of what church they attend or even if the attend church, can not only discover and register for those activities, but can also activate their own friends across the Bay Area to participate and organize inter-church activities.

Create technology to strengthen and increate the reach of churches in the Bay Area.
