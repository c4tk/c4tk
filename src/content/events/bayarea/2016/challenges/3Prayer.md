Prayer is at the center of our relationship with God. It is our means of communication with Him, it strengthens us as believers and as community, and it is how we seek for what God wants for us to do. While food, water, and air sustain life, Prayer sustains our spiritual life.

As Christians we are asked to never stop praying. Yet, the busy lifestyle created by  the rapid diffusion of digital technologies like mobile phones, social networking sites, and the Internet is resulting in an ever busy lifestyle that  significantly distracts us away from Prayer.  But what if we could use the very same technologies to encourage a Prayer?

How can technology connect, equip, encourage and care for those who want to be a part of the 24/7 Prayer Room community at Convergence House of Prayer and regional transformational opportunities in the Bay Area? 

How can technology help the 24/7 prayer room movement go viral, with millions of people creating virtual prayers rooms, inviting their friends, family and neighbors while connecting with the entire House of Prayer movement? 

Build technologies that activate, inform, and grow the 24/7 prayer community.  

Create solutions to mobilize 24/7 prayer for  ministries, schools, neighborhoods,friends, families. 

Leverage technology to discover and respond to how God is moving in the 24/7 prayer community in the Bay Area, the nation and across the globe.
