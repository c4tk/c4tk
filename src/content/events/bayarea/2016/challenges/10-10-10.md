Many of us feel called to being part of the fight against human trafficking. Yet, the majority of us do not know what we can do. The Bay Area Anti-Trafficking Coalition has been working with individuals, civic groups and non-profits to sustainably fight trafficking with the 10-10-10 philosophy. 10-10-10 encourages people to ask themselves what they can do in 10 minutes, 10 days and 10 months to fight trafficking, and then write ideas down, talk them over with family and friends, and commit time to act on those ideas.

You can create technology to help people create their own 10-10-10 either by selecting tasks from a growing suggested and vetted list from BAATC and other organizations, or by creating their own unique ideas. Your technology can allow individuals to create 10-10-10 challenges not only for themselves but for family and friends. What if you could create a way for a 10-10-10 challenge movement to go viral?
