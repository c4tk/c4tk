It is not just about serving; it is about serving well. Matching our gifts to serving opportunities help us fulfill 1 Peter 4:10 
<blockquote>"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms”. It is thru serving with our strengths, with our best, that we glorify God."</blockquote>

Help Venture Christian Church build sticky and delightful technology that will help connect people with the ministries where they can be the most impactful.
