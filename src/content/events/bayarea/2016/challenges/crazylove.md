Help Francis Chan and Crazylove bring the Read Scripture vision to our daily lives.

The following is from Francis Chan

<blockquote>
"The biggest need in the church today is intimacy with God.

I don’t hear of many people getting alone with God, adoring Him, enjoying Him, wanting to know Him better.  Do you?  I hear little of people living courageously as a result of the trust and love that has developed during their personal time Bible reading and prayer.  

I believe we are in the last days as mentioned in 2 Timothy 4 when people will seek teachers to suit their passions.  Rather than a willingness to honestly study the Word and humbly submit to it regardless of personal desire, they start with personal desires and find teachers who can prove biblically that their desires are allowable in scripture.  I believe a solution could be to challenge people to read the Bible for themselves.

The vast majority are headed for destruction (Matthew 7:13-14), so to be swept up in the flow of what’s popular will certainly lead to your own destruction.  Popular teaching will always be ungodly teaching.  It will be made to sound intelligent, reasonable, and even biblical.  Only as people humbly read His Word, wanting to find errors in their thinking will we arrive at truth.

I believe the greatest thing I can do for the Kingdom is to get people alone in the presence of the biblical God.  If Moses could have convinced the people of Israel to take turns walking up Mt Sinai to see and hear from God, they wouldn’t have built the golden calf.  If each Israelite had a tent of meeting where they regularly met with God, it would have kept them consistently in awe of Him resulting in holy living.  We must get people alone with God.  Godly teachers, leaders, and friends are helpful, but they are no substitute for God.  

I believe the best way to combat the false teaching of the world that has crept into the church is to get people to read the Word in isolation.  I’m all for community but only after each individual has spent time alone with Him.  Otherwise we are just arrogantly pooling our ignorance.

Read Scripture is our attempt to encourage and enable people to get alone with God and His Word on a regular basis.  While this does not solve all of the Church’s problems, it is where we must start.  If we skip this, everything else we build will eventually crumble. 

Read Scripture is an experience to get Christians and churches to learn how to read the Bible as they read the Bible.  We will couple a year long Bible reading plan with compelling videos that explain each book of the Bible, major theological themes and videos on how to read the Bible.  This will be housed in a web app for 2016 and a native iOS and Android app for 2017.  

Here’s a sample of the types of videos we’re creating.
