Terry Storch, co-founder of the YouVersion Bible Apps, challenges you in this video to innovate a great new way to interact with the Bible 

What would it look like if you would talk to the bible? How would someone who does not believe the Bible is real or does not know the Bible talk to the Bible?  How can the Bible interface with them in a real life conversation? What would it be like if the Bible talks back with him? 

How would AI interface with the Bible and deliver the search with my innermost need?

What would the Bible look like in a chat box environment?
