I have been in ministry for the last 10 years. I currently serve as a Campus Pastor and Chief Strategy Officer for a megachurch in Memphis, TN. I have been apart of the #C4TK movement since the first hackathon, and also serve on the global team. I have pitched and worked on projects that have centered on volunteer management and also spiritual gift analysis. | Area: Ministry and Strategy
