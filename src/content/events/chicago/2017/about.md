Let’s join together to create and showcase Chicagoland’s innovation and entrepreneurship in creating technologies addressing significant issues confronting society, community, families, and spiritual life.

The 2017 Chicago Code for the Kingdom hackahton builds upon the success of the previous 44 Code for Kingdom, that have been hosted in 32 cities in 12 countries. Those hackathons have already gathered over 4000 technologists who have created hundreds of projects to do good. Now is time to help release the talent and passion of Chicagoland. This Chicago collaboration will leverage the skills and insights of our entrepreneurs, designers, and technologists to make a lasting cultural impact.

Come, participate and address a number of challenges aimed at helping release the oppressed, teaching God’s Word, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and supporting the church and the body of Christ. 

Join us and let’s together create technology that matters.
