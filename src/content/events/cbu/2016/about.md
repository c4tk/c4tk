###What is Code for the Kingdom?

CBU students, have you ever wanted to impact your cities, circles and communities and solve problems that you see around you? Have you ever wanted to be the change? If yes, join us on March 3-5, 2016 for CBU's first ever Code for the Kingdom Hackathon.

Code for the Kingdom is a weekend Hackathon series and ongoing ecosystem where the challenges confronting our communities, our society, our families, and our spiritual lives are tackled from a Christian perspective. The movement hosts weekend gatherings in different cities where developers, designers, ideators and others collaborate to advance common good and serve God’s Kingdom.

This first Code for the Kingdom at CBU builds upon the success of previous hackathons, which have already gathered thousands of technologists to create hundreds of projects to do good. 

Join some of the most talented developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and creative people at CBU as they collaborate with each other to create innovative technology to help release the oppressed, teach God’s word, heal the sick, feed the hungry, clothe the naked and support the Church and the body of Christ.  

Join us this March 3-5 and let’s create technology that matters.
