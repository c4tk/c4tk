  answer:
    This Hackathon is a non-profit event to encourage the activation and on-going collaboration of a larger ecosystem of all sort of creative individuals ( including programmers, designers, creatives, entrepreneurs, and leaders of churches, non-profits, and the marketplace) who are passionate about creating technologies to tackle from a Christian perspective the challenges confronting our society, our communities, our churches, and our spiritual lives.
- question:
    What if I don’t know how to program?

- question:
    Do I have to bring my own laptop?   
  answer:
    Yes; we do not provide computers. Please bring anything you’ll need to code.  
- question:
    I can’t stay the entire time, can I still participate?   
  answer:
    Yes. We realize that some people might have other commitments, or might prefer to work remotely, or need to go home to rest and shower. Yet, you need to be present for the Thursday evening kickoff, and at some point you need be at the venue and do some work onsite. You will also need to be present for the final few hours for the presentations and judging.   
- question:
    Can I present a technology I already have?
  answer:
    You can build on top of something you have, but whatever you present must have new code developed in alignment with the spirit of the hackathon and you must do some of that coding at the hackathon venue during the hackathon hours.

    Do I have to work non-stop?
  answer:
    No. It is up to you and your team to decide on your work schedule.

    This is ultimately a question for your team. But neither the organizers nor Code for the Kingdom claims any ownership of any technologies you develop.
