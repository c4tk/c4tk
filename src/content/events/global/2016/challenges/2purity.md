The recent Ashley Madison hack--a website that connects people in order to have an affair--devastated many families with revelations of hitherto hidden infidelities. And grievously, even the names of leaders from the Christian community appeared in the leak. But we don’t have to look that far to find abuses of technology to promote sinful practice. Online pornography has been an increasingly dangerous threat to purity and faithfulness, making it easier than ever for people to commit adultery in their hearts.

According to [some statistics](http://www.roadtograce.net/current-porn-statistics/), many boys and girls are viewing porn before they reach their teens. 58% of over 2000 men surveyed believed viewing porn was wrong, but 56% admitted they tried to stop and could not. Porn has been a factor in 56% of divorce cases in the US and one study showed that porn users were 4 times more likely to visit a prostitute. Inevitably, demand for pornography [fuels demand for sex trafficking](http://www.covenanteyes.com/2011/09/07/the-connections-between-pornography-and-sex-trafficking/).

Instead of abusing technology to promote impurity, immorality and injustice, how can we leverage it to advance purity, faithfulness and righteousness like never before? 

How can technology help people enjoy the exceedingly superior promise of seeing God, which He reserves for the [pure in heart](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5&version=ESV)?

What tools can we invent to help people experience genuine connection and love instead of dulling the emptiness and pain of life with porn?

What tools can we invent to increase marital intimacy and contentment in singleness?

How can technology help marriages flourish as reflections of the love of Christ for his Church and our joyful devotion to Him?
