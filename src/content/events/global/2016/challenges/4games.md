A startling European study conducted by OneHope in 2014 showed that most youth were completely disinterested in God: discussing God, learning about God, reading material about God--everything was out of the question. 

In such environments, it is nearly impossible for even a contextualized version of the Gospel to take root. Instead, we need to work at the intersections of faith and culture--everything from business to science to movies to music to gaming--to demonstrate the significance of the Gospel for all of life. 

Games are notoriously fun, addictive, lucrative, pre-occupying and inviting. Oftentimes, these experiences are designed to leverage human psychology to keep people in an immersive state of “flow”, where they have a continual sense of challenge and accomplishment. This high engagement often translates into profit.

How can we instead leverage the best that game technology and psychology has to offer in order to help people engage with the Gospel of Jesus Christ?

Could you create a game that immerses people in a virtual world (e.g. Minecraft) that leads them to question their own presuppositions about the real world?

Could you craft a plotline that points characters and players to the only real hope for saving themselves and the world?

Could you design a fun casual game that helps people feed the hungry, engage with Scripture or serve their neighbor?

How do games fit in God’s Kingdom and how can we help players young and old experience a foretaste of that future today?
