Caring for children in the foster system is a powerful way to pro-actively address issues like homelessness, drug abuse, human trafficking, prostitution, and teen pregnancy.

Foster parents face difficult challenges on a daily basis. Children in foster care often come from traumatic experiences, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. On top of dealing with the trauma, gaining trust, providing at home health care, helping with the education and the recovery of the child, foster parents have to deal with babysitting, transportation, meals, housekeeping, court, social workers, and the spiritual wellbeing of a child in foster care. The burden on new foster parents is often overwhelming.

By helping unburden foster parents, support teams improve their lives and free them to give greater focus to the needs of their family, improving the chances of the foster child to adjust, recover, and grow healthier in a loving family.

Could you create technology to help reduce the burden and stress on foster parents by encouraging a culture of support for foster families?  By doing this you could help remove some of the barriers that prevent good people from becoming foster parents.
