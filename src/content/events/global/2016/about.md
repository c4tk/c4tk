In 2015, Code for the Kingdom hosted the first ever faith-inspired Global Hackathon Weekend in 13 cities across the world simultaneously.  It was a tremendous success with hundreds of participants creating over one hundred new technologies addressing significant issues confronting society, community, families, and spiritual life. 

In 2016, we are expanding Code for the Kingdom’s Global Hackathon to even more cities. Together with local organizers and partner organizations we share a common vision to provide more opportunities for communities around the world to participate and showcase innovation and entrepreneurship in their communities. 

This second Global Code for the Kingdom hackahton builds upon the success of the 2015 Global hackathon and previous regional hackathons, which have already gathered over 2500 technologists to create over 300 projects to do good. This largest ever global faith-inspired tech collaboration will continue to activate technologists and other creative people to give their skills and some time as their contribution to the mission field, and it will also leverage the skills and in- sights of entrepreneurs, designers, and technologists to foster an entrepreneurial culture with Christian values.
We expect over 1,500 people to participate and address a number of challenges aimed at helping release the oppressed, teaching God’s Word, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and supporting the church and the body of Christ. 

Come join us and let’s together create technology that matters.
