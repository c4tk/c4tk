<p>

A critical thinker/analyzer, problem-solver and engineer at mind and heart, Jonathan Tsai is passionate about finding the most efficient, secure, robust, scalable and reliable solution.

He is a product-focused generalist/full-stack software engineer, a jack-of-all-trades and master of several. He loves early stage startups, and that's why he has spent so many years at them. He enjoys architecting and implementing solutions from the ground up and working with and training talented engineers.

He is constantly searching for better methodologies and practices as a way to improve overall procedures, both for his own programming and for his department. Some concepts that he embraces fully are DRYness ("write once" philosophy), abstraction, and encapsulation.

He is a programming polyglot and also fluent in English, Chinese, and French.
