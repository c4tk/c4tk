Dusty Gulleson is Chief Executive Officer and has built eResources from a one-man web consulting firm into a thriving competitor in the Content Management, Online Application Management, and custom applications market. In addition to managing the growth and strategic vision of eResources, Gulleson serves as the Chief Software Designer. He is responsible for the design and development of the company’s flagship product eResources Content Management System and various SaaS-delivered custom applications, such as the paperless Online Application Manager.In 2012 he formed ORA, a mobile and community building app to introduce a new way to pray. ORA leverages existing social networks and mobile devices to connect individuals in the most meaningful relationship they can have with others and with God. ORA technology creates a personal mobile experience for the individual to invite, connect, share, respond and interact with one another in intercessory prayer. ORA collects, organizes, tracks, reminds, connects and securely shares prayer requests and answers with anyone you choose. ORA does this at a personal and intimate level with your friends and family through the mobile platform or 'app' on their smartphone. And ORA does this at the organization level through software that your organizations can use with your existing infrastructure (i.e. - church management software, emailing system, website cms, etc.)
