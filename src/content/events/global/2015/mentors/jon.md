Geek over at OneHope.

My responsibilities include making sure we are being the best stewards in our decisions regarding business technology solutions; adopting and integrating technology with a positive long term impact on the ministry; acting when necessary as an objective liaison between our different internal groups, our IT team, and our vendors.

Oh, and I fix things, all kinds of things. I am a fixer.
