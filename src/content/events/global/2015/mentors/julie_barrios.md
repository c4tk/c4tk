Julie Barrios serves as the Director of Spiritual Formation at Reality SF. She studied Spiritual Formation and Soul Care at Talbot School of Theology and is passionate about the interconnection of spiritual theology and every other craft of culture. It's in these intersections that we discover a robust, embodied awareness of what it means to be human. This was greatly influenced by her time at the Loyola Institute, where she specialized in Ignatian (Jesuit) spirituality and it's invitation to "find Christ in all things." With playful joy, Julie has made odd friendships with unlikely disciplines, developmental spirituality and fashion, technology, economics, and art, to name a few. She is a voracious learner and loves to discover Christ in new and unlikely ways.
