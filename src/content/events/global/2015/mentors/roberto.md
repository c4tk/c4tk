Roberto is currently Director of Mobile Design at Yahoo, where he helps lead a design team focused on native mobile experiences. His journey at Yahoo began less than a year ago after being acquired for a mobile product he helped design with his close friend. Prior to Yahoo, Roberto spent a couple of years at Google where he focused on UX design, however he jump started his career in software and design when he was recruited by Lockheed Martin when he was 17 years old. He is also a co-founder of ELEO (eleoconference.com), a meetup and conference held in the bay area that focuses on leadership + entrepreneurship.
