Code for the Kingdom, a Leadership Network hackathon initiative, convenes bright entrepreneurs and technologists to use their gifts to affect global culture from a Christian perspective. It seeks to advance the Gospel through the creation of new technologies addressing significant issues confronting society, community, families, and spiritual life.

In 2015, we are expanding Code for the Kingdom to include a Global Hackathon Weekend where we will host events in 12 locations simultaneously.  Our vision is to provide more opportunities for communities around the world to participate and showcase innovation and entrepreneurship in their communities.

If you are interested in getting involved, please complete the application and a member of the global leadership team will respond with further information.
