### 2015 Best of Code for the Kingdom Global award

At the end of the hackathons, the local judges of every city selected one or two projects to be submitted to the Global Judging Panel for consideration for the 2015 Best of Code for the Kingdom Global award. 

Our distinguished Global Judging panel included distinguished leaders from Venture Capital, Philanthropy, Higher Education, Non-Profits, Entrepreneurship, Church, Missions, Accelerators, Law, and Finance.

We are pleased to congratulate Baton, from the Dallas hackathon team led by Katy Gregory, as the recipient of the Best of Global Award for the Code for the Kingdom Global hackathon.

Baton is an app that serves as a tool for women across generations to connect, equip, and engage in intentional mentorship.

Baton users can create profiles and express the areas that are relevant to them and for which they seek mentoring. Mentoring needs could include anything from growing in their faith, their role as a leader in the workplace, the struggle in losing a loved one, and much more. Then based on needs, they are matched with a local woman who has walked a similar path so they can meet in real life for mentorship. Baton unleashes the power of connecting a woman with someone who won’t just speak into her life theoretically, but from a raw personal experience. The judges believe that Baton has a very real chance of affecting culture and transforming lives.

### Global 2015 People's Choice award award

In addition to the judging for the Best of Global award, the general public voted for the Global People’s Choice. Participating hackathon cities submitted their local People’s Choice winning project, which were then shared on social media. The public was invited to watch all the People’s Choice submission videos on Code for the Kingdom’s [Google+](https://plus.google.com/communities/112803271040533425213) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/code4thekingdom) accounts and then cast their votes by sharing, liking and retweeting their favorite project.

We are pleased to congratulate The Alexa Bible, from the Jakarta, Indonesia hackathon team led by Ronald Ishak, as the recipient  of the Global People’s Choice Award.

The Alexa Bible is a Bible app you can talk to built on the Amazon Echo. The Alexa Bible is a Bible for the blind, the elderly, and one that listens to you. While originally built for the Amazon platform, this project might also be built in the future for the Google and Windows platforms. We also see the Alexa Bible as having relevance to the preliterate and illeterate population.  It is estimated by UNESCO that over one billion of the world’s adults are illiterate and will never be reached with the printed page. As every person has the right to receive God’s Word in their own language, and only God’s truth has the ability to transform the heart and the mind, applications like the Alexa Bible are necessary to truly bring God’s Word to all.
