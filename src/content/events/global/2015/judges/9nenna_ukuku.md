Nnena is an attorney who works with early stage startups. Her focus has been on issues as diverse as formation to intellectual property. She works with them because, like her, they believe they can change their world and are passionate.

Nnena advises startups in a wide variety of matters regarding incorporation, initial founder and corporate documents, financing, copyright, and trademark. She also provides general business advice for our clients in areas such as setting up advisor agreements, privacy policies, and employment/contractor agreements within their company.

Her clients encompass a wide range of industries that are atypical such as construction technology and Bitcoin payment platforms to those that are more common such as social networking and fund formation.

She views the goal of her practice is to redefine what typical legal counsel is, which has been to provide just legal representation for her clients. She also constantly create new connections for our clients such as strategic partnerships, future employees or ways to finance their business.

She speaks frequently on matters from law to the startup ecosystem. 

Nnena is also the CEO and co-founder of Black Founder's Startup Ventures LLC. Nnena founded Black Founders because she wants to see minorities and women thrive and not simply survive in Silicon Valley.
