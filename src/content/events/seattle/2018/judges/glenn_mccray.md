Glenn McCray was born and raised in Seattle's Rainier Beach Neighborhood to an immigrant mother from the Philippines and an African-American father from Louisiana; in a community that has been among the most negatively stigmatized neighborhoods in the city. For over 15 years, Glenn has been working in Community Development; primarily working with young people, local schools, and the local church. Glenn currently serves on the Leadership Team with Urban Impact, a non-profit Christian Community Development organization whose mission is to partner with families and communities to break the cycle of social, material, and spiritual poverty. In his present role as Director of Church-based Community Development, Glenn has the privilege of participating in the ministry of reconciliation and working with churches to actualize their vision for community development in their neighborhood context. Among Glenn's proudest accomplishments is being married to his wife, Rev. Natasha Iwalani Hicks McCray, who serves as lead Pastor at Mt. View Presbyterian Church in White Center, where they also live and serve.
