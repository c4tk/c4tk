Ideate. Build. Impact.

Join us for a hackathon in Kirkland, WA, where you will spend the weekend creating technology that matters with like-minded people.

Developers, designers, entrepreneurs, creative individuals from all disciplines, investors, non-profits, and churches, will design and create new ways to tackle challenges confronting our society, our communities, and our lives from a Christian perspective.

###When
  Friday, March 9, 2018, 5:00 PM to Saturday, March 10, 2018, 5:30 PM

###Where
  * Northwest University
  * 5520 108th Ave Â· Kirkland, WA
  * Argue Health Sciences Building Room 231/233

###What to bring
Bring your laptop and other things you need to be creative and productive. If you have an idea you'd like to pitch, come with a 30 second elevator pitch. If you don't have an idea to pitch, you can work on your own, or join one of the many inspiring projects people are sharing.

###Important to know
  C4TK is FREE this year! Having said that, if you RSVP, but decide not to come, let us know ASAP so we can plan for food accordingly.

The venue will remain open non-stop during the entire 24 hours. You can go home and rest or work through the night to make something awesome--whichever you prefer!

####[Share Your Project Ideas](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-BPfQXgO845wPH2p1ujVCUSASe-Zv86EWDTKoHkbH-U/edit?usp=sharing)
We want to make this hackathon a success, particularly for people who spend the hackathon outside their technical comfort zone. So we are sharing [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-BPfQXgO845wPH2p1ujVCUSASe-Zv86EWDTKoHkbH-U/edit?usp=sharing) to help people get prepared in advance. For example, if someone plans to build a web app, they can explain what framework their using, tips for setting up a dev environment and tutorials so others can get familiar with the technology. Someone who typically works on a different framework can try it out to see if it's for them. We're hoping this will let people dive right in on hackathon day.

Parking is free.
