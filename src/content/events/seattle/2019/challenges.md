Don’t know what to work on? No problemo! Here are some challenge ideas to get your gears moving.

### **Spiritual Disciplines**

Many people find modern technology distracting. iOS and Android now include features for time tracking and notification management to help people take control of their digital attention. 

But something is missing…keeping our attention from being consumed with social media may be helpful, but how do we help people direct their attention to the things of God?

* How can you help people deeply engage with Scripture? 
* How can you help people discern God’s will? 
* How can you help people persevere in prayer? 
* How can you help people biblically rest and be refreshed? 

And what unique contribution does modern technology have to offer to help people lead disciplined, fruitful spiritual lives?

### **Practicing True Religion**

“Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and 
widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.” (James 1:27 NIV)

True religion seeks to love our neighbors and to show compassion to the distressed. What can we invent to help the least-resourced among us including the elderly, widows, orphans, people with severe disabilities and others? How can we assist the people and organizations that serve them? And of course, how can technology help people keep themselves from being polluted by the world?
