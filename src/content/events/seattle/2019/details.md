###What to bring
Bring your laptop and other things you need to be creative and productive. If you have an idea you'd like to pitch, come with a 30 second elevator pitch. If you don't have an idea to pitch, you can work on your own, or join one of the many inspiring projects people are sharing.

###Important to know
  C4TK is FREE! Having said that, if you RSVP, but decide not to come, let us know ASAP so we can plan for food accordingly.
