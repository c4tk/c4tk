Most organizations communicate via written text, but the reality is that 90% of the Deaf in the US graduate with a third grade reading level. Even Deaf-centric companies lack the tools they need to communicate well with their constituents.

How can we leverage video, virtual reality, images and other visual-based media to deliver amazing Deaf user experiences?

How can we help companies better manage their video, messaging and other interactions with Deaf constituents to ensure no one falls through the cracks?

How can we give a voice to the Deaf among the Hearing?

How can we use technology to ensure the Deaf have full access to the Gospel message, the Gospel community and the Gospel experience?
