intro: Global Responder Bot

Global Responder Bot is a chatbot that helps address the Syrian Refugee Crisis by leveraging technology to close gap between us and them, specifically a refugee child. It helps make meaningful connections with people by having the bot communicate their story. Specifically, when a global crisis happens, people get ask questions and get answers specific to the disaster. The Bot can help people get answers and show them ways they can help or be helped.
