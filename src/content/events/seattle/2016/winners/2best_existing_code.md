title: Best of Existing Code
intro: Moses Rod 
---
## Inspiration:
The Book of Exodus

## What it does:
Teaches Christian Kids and Teens how to build their own 3D Computer Bible Adventure Games. They learn the Bible as well as how to code.

## How we built it:
Unity 3D, C# and JavaScript

## Challenges we ran into:
Only 1 member of the quickly formed Hackathon Team knew how to use Unity 3D so much time was spent learning the 3D Game Engine Environment

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We were able to create a couple of Role Playing Game Bible Quests with an interactive audio and video enhanced story. We also wrote a chapter for the Quests & Crafting section of the Moses Rod RPG. We also had a lot of fun working together!

## What we learned:
Unity 3D, Game Development with 3D Animation & Graphics. The team also learned about how BibleByte Books & Games markets their computer programming tutorials to teachers, parents and students

## What's next for the Moses Rod 3D Bible Adventure Game Programming Tutorial For Christian Kids & Teens Expansion:
Additional tutorial chapters on Mecanim 3D animation and RPG Inventory Management. The Unity 3D Game Programming Tutorial is planned for release in 2017 for Christian Schools and Homeschool parents.
