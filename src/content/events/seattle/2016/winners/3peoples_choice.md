intro: GiveSafe 
---
The GiveSafe app exists to reveal the needs of those we pass everyday—the single mom on the bus, the grandfather on the street, the homeless teen outside the supermarket—and provide an effective, cashless way to respond. 

If you have the app and simply pass by a beacon holder, you receive a notification with the person's story. You can then give into a fund the individual can use on critical needs to leaving the streets with a case manager's help.

For this hackathon, we added a feature wher eyou can send words of encouragement to a person in need. Beacon holders can get their messages from a merchant. We also enabled volunteers to buy and hand out beacons on their own and we created a way for partner case managers to log monthly conversations.
