Scott helped found the creative non-profit organization, Created To Create. He is leading the team from Seattle to form community amongst creatives, serve churches and non-profit organizations in their photo/video/design needs, and introduce a fresh, open and invitational perspective to bringing God's Kingdom to the creative culture and industry. He enjoys shooting videos that share the Gospel, challenges others to serve, and happens to be a retired professional skateboarder still serving with the ministry Boarders For Christ.
