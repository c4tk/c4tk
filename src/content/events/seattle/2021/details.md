###When
  The event is virtual, and will be held in Remo. This platform allows participants to virtually sit at tables and collaborate with their team, and easily visit other tables to connect and share ideas with other teams during the event.

###How
  The event will start with a keynote kickoff, followed by one minute pitches from anyone who has an idea or a problem to solve. In the next portion, participants will decide which team to join, and the rest of the evening will be dedicated to team work time.

  On Saturday, teams will be visited by mentors from a variety of fields who will help support through feedback and question sessions. At the end of the day, teams will present their project to a panel of judges. Winners and awards will be announced Saturday evening.

We canâ€™t wait to begin creating with you!
