The movement hosts weekend gatherings in different cities where developers, designers, ideators and others collaborate to advance common good and serve God’s Kingdom.</p>
<p>The expansion of Code for the Kingdom to Orlando builds upon the success of previous regional events, which have already gathered over 1000 technologists to create over 100 projects to do good. This first Orlando collaboration will leverage the skills and insights of our entrepreneurs, designers, and technologists to foster an entrepreneurial culture with Christian values and activate technologists to give their skills and some time as their contribution to the mission field.</p>
<p>Join some of the most talented Developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and creative people in the country as they collaborate with each other, investors, mentors, innovative non-profits and churches to create technology to help release the oppressed, teach God’s word, heal the sick, feed the hungry, clothe the naked and support the Church and the body of Christ. 
Join us this May 22-24 and let’s create technology that matters. </p>

    <h3>Symbolic Bible Translation (when a language has no written words)</h3> 
  </div>
  <div class="9u challenge-description">
    <div class="expander intro">
      <span class="toggle-switch"></span>
      How do you translate the Bible into a language that has no written word? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>By using audio recordings, the Bible is able to be translated, shared, and heard. But this is a slow and time consuming process. Currently, symbols are created on paper to represent key thoughts in a specific order. This helps the translator remember the verses they hear and retain them as they speak passages from memory. What could be done to make this better and faster?</p>

    <div class="content">
<p>Imagine being asked an open-ended question. However, you must choose three relevant image cards from a larger deck of pictures to answer that question.  This results in an activity that is not only fun, but naturally stirs up great conversations.  Currently this activity exists as physical cards, but is being developed as an app.  We need your help to firstly, create the photo submission repository that allows for tagging and approval of localized photo sets. From there, you will help create photo repository API which populates the app to draw upon relevant photo sets for a guided and localized spiritual conversation.</p>

      Can technology engage an unengaged people group this weekend? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Are the 3,100 unreached people groups outside of the reach of digital engagement? The assumption is, yes, but a quick look at Facebook shows people from these unreached people groups are active and identified in Facebook. Ministries are developing video and text assets to reach these people with the gospel but the assets are disconnected from each other. By the end of the weekend, we will choose an unreached/unengaged people group, collect available digital assets in their language and create a digital engagement campaign. By Sunday afternoon, we pray people from this group will be engaging relevant spiritual content in their language with the opportunity to continue exploring if they choose. We also hope this could become a duplicatable ministry process for other organizations to continue using.</p>

      How can we leverage technology to foster Gospel-centered relationships -- marriage, family, friendships? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>We all know that technology can help facilitate better connection, but large social networks do not foster the type of intimate, private, and deep relationships that are needed to support such delicate dynamics as found in marriage, family, and close friendships. Apps and social networks that are designed to fulfill the individual’s need to be popular are not effective in cultivating scriptural-based relationships. </p>
<p>But what if you were to create an app that helps husbands and wives build gospel-centered marriages? ; Or a social network that fosters scriptural mentoring relationships between generations?; what if you were to create an Instagram like app to share beautiful Gospel-centered thoughts and images? 
How would you help ignite a cultural swift? &quot; </p>

      Multimedia Bible stories are an effective way of evangelizing and discipling around the globe.  Can we create an effective way to download and share audio and video of Open Bible Stories in the unfoldingWord app? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>The unfoldingWord app currently supports viewing images and text together, but we could appeal to more people and to those who are illiterate if we can support audio and video as well.  The app will need to preserve an offline-first mentality, but still provide a way for users to get, view, and share the multimedia content.

      The Global Church needs a web viewer for Scripture (like Bible.org &amp; BibleGateway.com), based on openly licensed Scripture, to output in a variety of formats. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Many parts of the world are not able to use versions of the Bible that we rely on every day, because they are copyrighted.  Access to the Bible is needed not only for blessing the reader but as a source text for other languages. This web viewer would use the unfoldingWord API to reference open-source (free-to-all) Scripture and provide it in a multitude of formats: to the screen, PDF, USFM, Docx, ODT, epub, etc.

What if a phone user could send a message to this new software and receive in return a verse of the day or devotional material?  What if text could be used to search the bible? What if you could text “Philippians 1:6” – and get in return the associated verse – “Being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.”?

      How can you leverage Raspberry Pi to increase scripture access? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Raspberry Pi is a disruptive low-power, low-cost platform that has tremendous potential to impact all phases of scripture access. It could be used to host a collaboration server for teams translating scripture. It could host a local web server to share Bible content. The possibilities are endless. Can you make a Raspberry Pi product that’s ready to ship out at the end of the weekend?  Can you show others how to do it?
Tremendous amounts of free access scripture materials are being created, and for the first time these materials will have no copyright restrictions. What can you dream up to package scripture onto a tiny portable server that could be taken into the hardest places? How easy can you make the process, and how easily can you communicate the instructions?</p>

<h3 id="wycliffe-associates-our-orlando-host">Wycliffe Associates, our Orlando Host</h3>
<p>Wycliffe Associates accelerates Bible translation around the world by empowering national translators and equipping the local church to share God’s Word in their own heart languages.</p>
<p>At least 1.3 billion people don&#39;t have the full Bible in their own language. 7,000 languages are in the world, but only 2888 languages have even just some Scripture translated. Only 531 languages have the complete Bible. Millions of people are waiting for God&#39;s Word in the language of their heart. Christian organizations and churches across the globe have united in Vision 2025, the commitment to initiate a translation in all languages which still need the Bible by the year 2025. We have less than 10 years to fulfill our commitment. </p>
<p>God is on the move. Breakthrough techniques developed in just the past year are enabling the New Testament to be translated in as little as two weeks with pen and paper. Teams are deploying satellite internet to places that don&#39;t even have electricity in order to connect local churches with Bible scholars on other continents. Apps are being developed to equip persecuted Christians in the most difficult parts of the world.</p>
<p>What is accomplished here will transform lives and change the world for Christ.What can you create to accelerate Bible translation? </p>

  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">I can’t stay the entire time, can I still participate?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes. We realize that 47 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments, or might prefer to work remotely, or need to go home/hotel to rest and shower. Yet, you need to be present for the initial few hours during the startup demos, and at some point you need be at the venue and do some work onsite. You will also need to be present for the final few hours for the presentations and judging.</p>
