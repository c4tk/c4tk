Are you an entrepreneur, technologist or innovator? Have you ever wanted to impact your cities, circles and communities and solve problems that you see around you? If yes, don’t miss out on India’s first mission-based weekend Hackathon that kicks off on Oct 31, 2014!</p>
<p>Code for the Kingdom is a weekend Hackathon series and ongoing ecosystem where global issues are tackled from a Christian perspective. The movement hosts weekend gatherings in different cities where developers, designers, ideators and others collaborate to advance common good and serve God’s Kingdom.</p>
<p>Code for the Kingdom hosted its first-of-a-kind mission based weekend Hackathon in San Francisco last year. In the span of a year, the weekend event gathered momentum and members with weekend gatherings across Austin, Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area. Now, for the first time, Code for the Kingdom is expanding beyond American shores and what better destination to connect technologists than Bangalore, India?</p>
<p>Join the top 100 leaders in the country as they collaborate with innovative non-profits and churches to write code and create technology to help release the oppressed, teach God’s word, heal the sick, feed the hungry, clothe the naked and support the church and the body of Christ. </p>
<p>This weekend event will focus the passion, purpose, and creativity of our entrepreneurial and creative community, connecting incredible innovators with organizations, and initiatives that need their talent.
Join us in Bangalore, India as we battle the challenges confronting our communities, our society, our families, and our spiritual lives.</p>

          <h3>Help Create a culture of Generosity</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The Follower of Christ is called to a life of generous sacrifice extending beyond simple financial generosity, to include generosity of our mind, time and possessions. If the Kingdom of God is to truly to be advanced by us, we need to answer the call of radical generosity. It is only when we live out this radical generosity that the Church will be unleashed in thoughtfulness, action, and resources to advance the Kingdom of God in the world. Create technology to encourage individuals and families to become generous in every aspect of their lives.

        </header>
        <p>Every person has something unique to contribute to the community, society, and church. Yet, most of us do not understand how we can leverage our skills and ideas to improve the lives of others.

What if we could discover how to use our unique gifts for God’s Kingdom? Use technology to mobilize and equip every member of your community, church and family. Empower them to release their skills as well as to accelerate great ideas and initiatives that could transform the lives of the child or adult down your street.

    <h3>Stop violence against women and girls</h3>

  <div class="9u challenge-description">
    <div class="expander intro">
      <span class="toggle-switch"></span>
      How can technology help women and girls be safe and change the culture of violence? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>According to UNICEF, 51% of men in India believe wife beating can be justified. And, incredibly enough 54.4% of women in India also believe in justified wife beatings. When violence justification is such a cultural belief, it is not a surprise that most women in India do not feel safe in public spaces. One rape happens every 30 minutes in India, according to the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative. </p>
<p>There is no doubt that regardless of social-economic advances, stopping violence against women and girls requires spiritual and cultural transformation that only Jesus can bring. Jesus commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves. He said that is the second most important commandment, and it is that love that will stop the violence. </p>
<p>How can we help leverage technological advances so that all women and children in India can live freely without fear of crimes or atrocities against them? How can technology help alert, connect and protect God&#39;s precious people before any chance of crime can befall them?  How can technology encourage men in India to stand against the violence towards women? How can technology help change a culture where neighbors commit acts of violence, condemnation, or indifference towards women, into a culture where neighbors love neighbors and protect the woman and girl down the street?</p>

  <div class="content">
<p>Possibly. You can use the Code for the Kingdom Facebook Community <a href="https://www.facebook.com/c4tkIndia"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/c4tkIndia">https://www.facebook.com/c4tkIndia</a></a> at anytime to meet other participants, propose ideas, and recruit or be recruited into a team. But you can also bring your own team, or come alone and become part of a team at the event.</p>

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Can I present a technology that I have already built or worked on?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>You can build on top of something you have, but whatever you present must be in alignment with the event theme and have something new created for at least one of the challenges or projects of the event and you must do some of that work at the venue during the event hours.</p>

  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Won’t other teams who are building on top of their existing works, have an unfair advantage over people like me who plan to start creating during the actual event hours?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Not at all. There will be separate prizes, but of similar amount, for teams that present projects built on their existing works, and for teams that start fresh at the event. We want to honor all of you, regardless of whether you have been working for a while on something you are passionate about, or whether you decide on something brand new.</p>
