<h2>Chris Lim <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-lim-7472631/" class="icon circle fa-linkedin-square"></a></h2>
<h1> Seattle, WA <h1>
Christopher Lim is founder of <a style="color:white" href="http://www.theotech.org">TheoTech</a>, a company activating a movement of Technology Entrepreneurship for the Gospel. This means beginning with God as the Customer and working backwards to create the things He desires to see in the world.

As a practitioner, Chris is focused on <a style="color:white" href="http://www.ceaselessprayer.com">Ceaseless</a>, a technologyÂ­supported movement to personally pray for everyone on earth. He is also developing a system to help churches reflect the multilingual glory of God's kingdom by subtitling messages in real time so that congregations no longer need to be segregated by language.

Chris loves seeing the implications of a thoughtful theology of technology worked out in real world products that transform people's lives and give them a foretaste of God's Kingdom.
