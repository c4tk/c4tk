<p>Code for the Kingdom, a Leadership Network hackathon initiative, convenes bright entrepreneurs and technologists to use their gifts to affect global culture from a Christian perspective. It seeks to advance the Gospel through the creation of new technologies addressing significant issues confronting society, community, families, and spiritual life.</p>
<p>In 2015, we are expanding Code for the Kingdom to include a Global Hackathon Weekend where we are collaborating with Indigitous - a global community of people passionate about connecting people to Jesus using digital strategies - to host events in 13 locations simultaneously. </p>
<p>Together our vision is to provide more opportunities for communities around the world to participate and showcase innovation and entrepreneurship in their communities. We expect over 1,500 people to participate and address a number of challenges aimed at helping release the oppressed, teaching God’s Word, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and supporting the church and the body of Christ.</p>

<h3 id="2015-best-of-code-for-the-kingdom-global-award">2015 Best of Code for the Kingdom Global award</h3>
<p>At the end of the hackathons, the local judges of every city selected one or two projects to be submitted to the Global Judging Panel for consideration for the 2015 Best of Code for the Kingdom Global award. </p>
<p>Our distinguished Global Judging panel included distinguished leaders from Venture Capital, Philanthropy, Higher Education, Non-Profits, Entrepreneurship, Church, Missions, Accelerators, Law, and Finance.</p>
<p>We are pleased to congratulate Baton, from the Dallas hackathon team led by Katy Gregory, as the recipient of the Best of Global Award for the Code for the Kingdom Global hackathon.</p>
<p>Baton is an app that serves as a tool for women across generations to connect, equip, and engage in intentional mentorship.</p>
<p>Baton users can create profiles and express the areas that are relevant to them and for which they seek mentoring. Mentoring needs could include anything from growing in their faith, their role as a leader in the workplace, the struggle in losing a loved one, and much more. Then based on needs, they are matched with a local woman who has walked a similar path so they can meet in real life for mentorship. Baton unleashes the power of connecting a woman with someone who won’t just speak into her life theoretically, but from a raw personal experience. The judges believe that Baton has a very real chance of affecting culture and transforming lives.</p>

<h3 id="global-2015-people-s-choice-award-award">Global 2015 People&#39;s Choice award award</h3>
<p>In addition to the judging for the Best of Global award, the general public voted for the Global People’s Choice. Participating hackathon cities submitted their local People’s Choice winning project, which were then shared on social media. The public was invited to watch all the People’s Choice submission videos on Code for the Kingdom’s <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/112803271040533425213">Google+</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/code4thekingdom">Twitter</a> accounts and then cast their votes by sharing, liking and retweeting their favorite project.</p>
<p>We are pleased to congratulate The Alexa Bible, from the Jakarta, Indonesia hackathon team led by Ronald Ishak, as the recipient  of the Global People’s Choice Award.</p>
<p>The Alexa Bible is a Bible app you can talk to built on the Amazon Echo. The Alexa Bible is a Bible for the blind, the elderly, and one that listens to you. While originally built for the Amazon platform, this project might also be built in the future for the Google and Windows platforms. We also see the Alexa Bible as having relevance to the preliterate and illeterate population.  It is estimated by UNESCO that over one billion of the world’s adults are illiterate and will never be reached with the printed page. As every person has the right to receive God’s Word in their own language, and only God’s truth has the ability to transform the heart and the mind, applications like the Alexa Bible are necessary to truly bring God’s Word to all.</p>

  <div class="6u content mentor-description">
    Jeff Sandefer started his first business at age sixteen. After earning an MBA, he founded Sandefer Offshore, an oil and gas company that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in profits in less than five years. He then ran Sandefer Capital Partners, a half-billion dollar energy investment fund.

Over the last fifteen years, Sandefer has worked with entrepreneur-teachers to build a nationally acclaimed entrepreneurship program, winning numerous teaching honors in the process. But ask him about success, and he makes it clear that money and awards aren’t what matter.

“My great-grandfather found his calling as president of a small college and is buried on the campus he worked so hard to build. On one side of his tombstone it says: ‘If you would see his monument, look around.’ This reminds me each of us wants to contribute something meaningful with our lives. On the other side of the tombstone is inscribed, ‘A good name is rather to be had than great riches.’ This reminds me that leading a good life is even more important than what you contribute.”

“We want students who have the intelligence and drive to change the world, and the integrity to change it for the better. If we can awaken in each student a sense of their God-given gifts, and help them to use these gifts to make a difference, the Acton MBA in Entrepreneurship will change the world, one student at a time.”

      What if you could create wearable technology to advance the gospel and help people live a Gospel centered life? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Wearable technology is the new frontier for the digital lifestyle. Whether it’s an Apple Watch, FitBit or Misfit, these new devices make us aware of our surroundings in subtle ways that are embedded in our lives more deeply than ever before.</p>
<p>What would it look like to pioneer wearable technology from a Christian perspective?</p>
<p>What could we create?</p>
<p>Could we use wearables to keep women and children safe from predators?</p>
<p>Could we detect people’s moods and notify loved ones to reach out with prayer, God&#39;s Word, and care when they are feeling down?</p>
<p>Could we use wearables to better connect us to the sick and lonely in order to serve them?</p>
<p>And of course, how can wearables help us stay connected with our spouses, parents, children, friends, and others for the sake of prayer and sharing the Gospel?</p>
<p>How does the hope of God&#39;s kingdom shape our use of wearables, enabling us to better love others?</p>

    <h3>Protecting marriages and cultivating pure hearts through technology</h3> 
  </div>
  <div class="9u challenge-description">
    <div class="expander intro">
      <span class="toggle-switch"></span>
      How can technology promote purity and faithfulness in singleness and marriage? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>The recent Ashley Madison hack--a website that connects people in order to have an affair--devastated many families with revelations of hitherto hidden infidelities. And grievously, even the names of leaders from the Christian community appeared in the leak. But we don’t have to look that far to find abuses of technology to promote sinful practice. Online pornography has been an increasingly dangerous threat to purity and faithfulness, making it easier than ever for people to commit adultery in their hearts.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.roadtograce.net/current-porn-statistics/">some statistics</a>, many boys and girls are viewing porn before they reach their teens. 58% of over 2000 men surveyed believed viewing porn was wrong, but 56% admitted they tried to stop and could not. Porn has been a factor in 56% of divorce cases in the US and one study showed that porn users were 4 times more likely to visit a prostitute. Inevitably, demand for pornography <a href="http://www.covenanteyes.com/2011/09/07/the-connections-between-pornography-and-sex-trafficking/">fuels demand for sex trafficking</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of abusing technology to promote impurity, immorality and injustice, how can we leverage it to advance purity, faithfulness and righteousness like never before? </p>
<p>How can technology help people enjoy the exceedingly superior promise of seeing God, which He reserves for the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5&amp;version=ESV">pure in heart</a>?</p>
<p>What tools can we invent to help people experience genuine connection and love instead of dulling the emptiness and pain of life with porn?</p>
<p>What tools can we invent to increase marital intimacy and contentment in singleness?</p>
<p>How can technology help marriages flourish as reflections of the love of Christ for his Church and our joyful devotion to Him?</p>

      How can we ensure everyone on earth can safely access the Bible in their own language, even in the most remote and hostile corners of the world? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>As Christians we are called to bring the hope of the Gospel to every person on the planet and as Paul demonstrated in 1 Corinthians 9:19-23, we ought to present the Gospel to people in light of their technological needs and preferences.  </p>
<p>How can we meet them where they are at with the technologies, media, and format that are relevant to them? How do we serve people in lower-technology settings, using different social platforms, dwelling in different cultures, and living in hostile situations?</p>
<p>How can we ensure the Scriptures are available in every medium from mobile &amp; web apps, to social media and messaging platforms, to basic SMS, etc.? What new technology can you invent to make Scripture Engagement go viral?</p>
<p>How can we help people groups across the countries find the Bible in their heart language, the language their mothers spoke to them in, the language they pray in, across different platforms? Could you a create social awareness campaign for the Bible (leveraging the Digital Bible Platform API) to share the Good News in your country on the relevant social media platforms?</p>
<p>How can technology help ethnic minority Christians living in hostile environments reach their non-Christian neighbors? How can it empower &amp; encourage them to make disciples? How can it help protect minorities from persecution while creating safe places for Muslims to engage with the Gospel?</p>
<p>How can technology help missional communities share the best resources that help them share Jesus with others in their community? Could you create a slack integration that enables people to share and review resources?</p>

      Can we invent games that will help future generations seek, desire, delight in, and know God? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>A startling European study conducted by OneHope in 2014 showed that most youth were completely disinterested in God: discussing God, learning about God, reading material about God--everything was out of the question. </p>
<p>In such environments, it is nearly impossible for even a contextualized version of the Gospel to take root. Instead, we need to work at the intersections of faith and culture--everything from business to science to movies to music to gaming--to demonstrate the significance of the Gospel for all of life. </p>
<p>Games are notoriously fun, addictive, lucrative, pre-occupying and inviting. Oftentimes, these experiences are designed to leverage human psychology to keep people in an immersive state of “flow”, where they have a continual sense of challenge and accomplishment. This high engagement often translates into profit.</p>
<p>How can we instead leverage the best that game technology and psychology has to offer in order to help people engage with the Gospel of Jesus Christ?</p>
<p>Could you create a game that immerses people in a virtual world (e.g. Minecraft) that leads them to question their own presuppositions about the real world?</p>
<p>Could you craft a plotline that points characters and players to the only real hope for saving themselves and the world?</p>
<p>Could you design a fun casual game that helps people feed the hungry, engage with Scripture or serve their neighbor?</p>
<p>How do games fit in God’s Kingdom and how can we help players young and old experience a foretaste of that future today?</p>

      How can we leverage inexpensive virtual reality technologies like Google Cardboard to create immersive experiences that motivate people to help solve global challenges like the Clean Water crisis? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Most people do not realize that an estimated 663 million people lack access to safe drinking water. Or that about every 90 seconds, a child under 5 dies as a result of diarrhea caused by contaminated water, poor sanitation, and unsafe hygiene practices. Let’s change that. </p>
<p>Your challenge is to bring awareness to the global water crisis through an immersive virtual reality experience. Leveraging Google Cardboard create a mobile experience that informs the public of the challenges associated with contaminated water and connect the public with opportunities to be part of the solution.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="9u challenge-description">
    <div class="expander intro">
      <span class="toggle-switch"></span>
      How can we use technology to enable and inspire people to be radically generous? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Jesus Christ said, “It is more blessed to give than to receive” <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+20%3A35&amp;version=ESV">(Acts 20:35)</a>. Yet many times we find it hard to believe. Our view of giving is often limited to money such that we ignore what God truly desires--our hearts and everything that flows from it as described in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isa+58%3A6-12&amp;version=ESV">Isaiah 58:6-12</a>. God wants more than religious actions, he wants our fasting to result in freedom for and radical generosity towards the weak, the poor and the oppressed.</p>
<p>How can technology help people experience the joy of giving above and beyond their money? How can it unleash people to radical acts of generosity that spurs others on as well? How can you make generosity go viral?</p>
<p>With so many generosity apps focused on processing online giving, what new technology can you create to foster a more holistic and lasting generosity? Could you change the paradigm of online giving? </p>
<p>Can your creations inspire children to be generous with thoughts, time and resources? What if you created a simulation game to help children understand the consequences of stinginess in contrast to the blessings of generosity for their family, community and society?</p>
<p>Could you create an app or micro-social network that leverages social effects to motivate you and your friends to compete in showing generosity and kindness towards others?</p>

Julie Barrios serves as the Director of Spiritual Formation at Reality SF. She studied Spiritual Formation and Soul Care at Talbot School of Theology and is passionate about the interconnection of spiritual theology and every other craft of culture.  It&#39;s in these intersections that we discover a robust, embodied awareness of what it means to be human.  This was greatly influenced by her time at the Loyola Institute, where she specialized in Ignatian (Jesuit) spirituality and it&#39;s invitation to &quot;find Christ in all things.&quot; With playful joy, Julie has made odd friendships with unlikely disciplines, developmental spirituality and fashion, technology, economics, and art, to name a few. She is a voracious learner and loves to discover Christ in new and unlikely ways.<br></p><br>  </div>
