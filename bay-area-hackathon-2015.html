<p>Are you an entrepreneur, technologist or innovator? Have you ever wanted to impact your cities, circles and communities and solve problems that you see around you? Have you ever wanted to be the change? If yes, join us on November 13-15, 2015 for the Bay Area&#39;s third Code for the Kingdom Hackathon, hosted by Venture Christian Church. </p>
<p>Code for the Kingdom is a weekend Hackathon series and ongoing ecosystem where the challenges confronting our communities, our society, our families, and our spiritual lives are tackled from a Christian perspective. The movement hosts weekend gatherings in different cities where developers, designers, ideators and others collaborate to advance common good and serve God’s Kingdom.</p>
<p>This third Code for the Kingdom in the Bay Area builds upon the success of previous hackathons, which have already gathered over thousands of technologists to create hundreds of projects to do good. This Bay Area collaboration will leverage the skills and insights of our entrepreneurs, designers, and technologists to foster an entrepreneurial culture with Christian values and activate technologists to give their skills and some time as their contribution to the mission field.</p>
<p>Join some of the most talented developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and creative people in the country as they collaborate with each other to create innovative technology. All of these groups will also work with investors, mentors, innovative non-profits and churches to come up with ideas and projects to help release the oppressed, teach God’s word, heal the sick, feed the hungry, clothe the naked and support the Church and the body of Christ.  </p>
<p>Join us this November 13-15 and let’s create technology that matters. </p>

    <h3>10-10-10 to fight human trafficking</h3> 
  </div>
  <div class="9u challenge-description">
    <div class="expander intro">
      <span class="toggle-switch"></span>
      How can technology help activate individuals, families, and groups of friends to take tangible action to fight human trafficking in 10 minutes, 10 days, and 10 months? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Many of us feel called to being part of the fight against human trafficking. Yet, the majority of us do not know what we can do. The Bay Area Anti-Trafficking Coalition has been working with individuals, civic groups and non-profits to sustainably fight trafficking with the 10-10-10 philosophy. 10-10-10 encourages people to ask themselves what they can do in 10 minutes, 10 days and 10 months to fight trafficking, and then write ideas down, talk them over with family and friends, and commit time to act on those ideas.</p>
<p>You can create technology to help people create their own 10-10-10 either by selecting tasks from a growing suggested and vetted list from BAATC and other organizations, or by creating their own unique ideas. Your technology can allow individuals to create 10-10-10 challenges not only for themselves but for family and friends. What if you could create a way for a 10-10-10 challenge movement to go viral?</p>

    <h3>Adopt a School with TBC</h3> 
  </div>
  <div class="9u challenge-description">
    <div class="expander intro">
      <span class="toggle-switch"></span>
      How can technology encourage churches, non-profits, and businesses in the Bay Area to adopt schools and respond the community needs? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Transforming the Bay with Christ is leading a coalition of business leaders, venture capitalists, pastors, and non-profit leaders, to activate a grass roots movement that will transform the Bay Area through social compassion and service. One of the initiatives that TBC is fostering is the adoption of each school in the Bay Area by a church, a non-profit, or a business with the intention of serving as a champion that would voice and help meet the need of the adopted school.</p>
<p>You can create technology to help this vision become a reality. Your creation could map and help identify schools that are not yet adopted. It could also map the level and frequency of engagement that the adopting organization is giving on an ongoing basis to foster the relationship with the school and met the need.  It is not enough to mark a school as adopted; adopting is just the beginning of a growth journey towards health and excellence.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can create technology to activate other parts of the TBC movement to collaborate with the adopting organization to meet the need of the school.  And so much more.</p>

<p>Help Francis Chan and Crazylove bring the Read Scripture vision to our daily lives.</p>
<p>The following is from Francis Chan</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;The biggest need in the church today is intimacy with God.

I don’t hear of many people getting alone with God, adoring Him, enjoying Him, wanting to know Him better.  Do you?  I hear little of people living courageously as a result of the trust and love that has developed during their personal time Bible reading and prayer.<br>
I believe we are in the last days as mentioned in 2 Timothy 4 when people will seek teachers to suit their passions.  Rather than a willingness to honestly study the Word and humbly submit to it regardless of personal desire, they start with personal desires and find teachers who can prove biblically that their desires are allowable in scripture.  I believe a solution could be to challenge people to read the Bible for themselves.

The vast majority are headed for destruction (Matthew 7:13-14), so to be swept up in the flow of what’s popular will certainly lead to your own destruction.  Popular teaching will always be ungodly teaching.  It will be made to sound intelligent, reasonable, and even biblical.  Only as people humbly read His Word, wanting to find errors in their thinking will we arrive at truth.

I believe the greatest thing I can do for the Kingdom is to get people alone in the presence of the biblical God.  If Moses could have convinced the people of Israel to take turns walking up Mt Sinai to see and hear from God, they wouldn’t have built the golden calf.  If each Israelite had a tent of meeting where they regularly met with God, it would have kept them consistently in awe of Him resulting in holy living.  We must get people alone with God.  Godly teachers, leaders, and friends are helpful, but they are no substitute for God.<br>
I believe the best way to combat the false teaching of the world that has crept into the church is to get people to read the Word in isolation.  I’m all for community but only after each individual has spent time alone with Him.  Otherwise we are just arrogantly pooling our ignorance.

Read Scripture is our attempt to encourage and enable people to get alone with God and His Word on a regular basis.  While this does not solve all of the Church’s problems, it is where we must start.  If we skip this, everything else we build will eventually crumble. 

Read Scripture is an experience to get Christians and churches to learn how to read the Bible as they read the Bible.  We will couple a year long Bible reading plan with compelling videos that explain each book of the Bible, major theological themes and videos on how to read the Bible.  This will be housed in a web app for 2016 and a native iOS and Android app for 2017.<br>
Here’s a sample of the types of videos we’re creating.

      How can games impart the need and benefits of being generous to the mobile first generation of children? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Knowing that generosity brings about spiritual growth and that generosity is a like a muscle (the sooner they start exercising it the stronger the person will become), how can technology help children become generous? What if games could simulate the personal, familiar, and communal growth or decline that comes with being generous of mind, time, love, and resources? And could a game show the eventual decline when generosity is not exercised?</p>
<p>How could games be used creatively to teach children about generosity?</p>
