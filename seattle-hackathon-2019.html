<p>  C4TK is FREE! Having said that, if you RSVP, but decide not to come, let us know ASAP so we can plan for food accordingly.</p>

<p>The fifth Seattle Code for the Kingdom hackathon builds upon the success of the 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2018 Seattle Code for the Kingdom hackathons, as well as the 2015 Global hackathon and previous regional hackathons, which have already gathered over 3500 technologists to create over 330 projects to do good. This largest ever global faith-inspired tech collaboration will continue to activate technologists and other creative people to give their skills and some time as their contribution to the mission field, and it will also leverage the skills and insights of entrepreneurs, designers, and technologists to foster an entrepreneurial culture with Christian values.</p>
<p>Come, participate and address a number of challenges aimed at helping release the oppressed, teaching Godâs Word, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and supporting the church and the body of Christ. </p>
<p>Join us and letâs together create technology that matters.</p>

<p>Donât know what to work on? No problemo! Here are some challenge ideas to get your gears moving.</p>
<h3 id="-spiritual-disciplines-"><strong>Spiritual Disciplines</strong></h3>
<p>Many people find modern technology distracting. iOS and Android now include features for time tracking and notification management to help people take control of their digital attention. </p>
<p>But something is missingâ¦keeping our attention from being consumed with social media may be helpful, but how do we help people direct their attention to the things of God?</p>
<ul>
<li>How can you help people deeply engage with Scripture? </li>
<li>How can you help people discern Godâs will? </li>
<li>How can you help people persevere in prayer? </li>
<li>How can you help people biblically rest and be refreshed? </li>
</ul>
<p>And what unique contribution does modern technology have to offer to help people lead disciplined, fruitful spiritual lives?</p>
<h3 id="-practicing-true-religion-"><strong>Practicing True Religion</strong></h3>
<p>âReligion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and 
widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.â (James 1:27 NIV)</p>
<p>True religion seeks to love our neighbors and to show compassion to the distressed. What can we invent to help the least-resourced among us including the elderly, widows, orphans, people with severe disabilities and others? How can we assist the people and organizations that serve them? And of course, how can technology help people keep themselves from being polluted by the world?</p>

    Kevin Kim is the Executive Director of <a href="http://www.crazylove.org/">Crazy Love</a> in San Francisco, co-founder of a faith-based technology organization called Basil Tech, co-founder of a startup called Common Coin and an elder and pastor at <a href="http://www.wearechurch.com/">We Are Church</a>. 

He grew up near Richmond, Virginia and received his B.A in Biology from the University of Virginia because his mother told him that Korean people are supposed to be doctors.
<br/><br/>

He believed her until he met Korean people who were not doctors. It was a moment of existential trauma for him. He&#39;s still recovering.
<br/><br/>

To the chagrin of his parents (they&#39;re OK now but it took them a while) he became a minister. That calling to full-time ministry was part prayer, part conviction, part encouragement from his church and part organic chemistry. Who are we kidding? Orgo was a huge part of that.
<br/><br/>

He went to seminary near Philadelphia and received a M.Div and a wife from Biblical Theological Seminary. Thanks BTS on both counts!
<br/><br/>

In 2007 he moved to Northern California to join the staff at <a href="http://menlo.church/">Menlo Church</a>. At Menlo he served as a Student Ministries Director, Campus Pastor, Teaching Pastor, Director of Innovation and resident male model for diversity.
<br/><br/>

He also had the unique privilege of working with <a href="http://garyhamel.com/">Gary Hamel</a> and <a href="http://ideo.com/">IDEO</a> on a 2-year project called Catalyst.  Catalyst was a project designed to help the church think and be more innovative in its mission and ministry. 
<br/><br/>

Catalyst used <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/">d.thinking</a> and other innovative processes to help launch missional communities, kingdom businesses, tech hackathons and such...for an idea of what the design thinking process looks like click <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M66ZU2PCIcM">here</a>.
<br/><br/>

In 2013 he moved to San Francisco to help plant family churches with <a href="http://www.wearechurch.com/">We Are Church</a>. He lives in San Francisco with his wife and his 3 children--Karis, Ellie and Isaiah.
<br/><br/>

He is currently working on an exciting project called <a href="http://www.readscripture.org/">Read Scripture</a> which you can download in the App Store and Google Play.

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">What&#x27;s a hackathon?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>A hackathon is an event where people get together and develop some awesome technologies in a short time span. Think of it as a creative marathon where at the end you have some product to show for.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">What is this hackathon trying to accomplish?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>This Hackathon is a non-profit event to encourage the activation and on-going collaboration of a larger ecosystem of all sort of creative individuals ( including programmers, designers, creatives, entrepreneurs, and leaders of churches, non-profits, and the marketplace) who are passionate about creating technologies to tackle from a Christian perspective the challenges confronting our society, our communities, our churches, and our spiritual lives.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">I&#x27;m not Christian. Can I still participate?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">What if I donât know how to program?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Everyone has something to offer to help transform lives. If you come full of ideas there will be technologists eager to be in a team with you.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Do I have to bring my own laptop?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes; we do not provide computers. Please bring anything youâll need to code.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">I canât stay the entire time, can I still participate?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes. We realize that 24 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments, or might prefer to work remotely, or need to go home/hotel to rest and shower. Yet, you need to be present for the initial few hours during the startup demos, and at some point you need be at the venue and do some work onsite. You will also need to be present for the final few hours for the presentations and judging.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Can I present a technology I already have?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>You can build on top of something you have, but whatever you present must have new code developed for at least one of the challenges of the hackathon and you must do some of that coding at the hackathon venue during the hackathon hours.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Wonât other teams who are building on top of technologies they already developed, not have an unfair advantage over me who plans to start coding during the actual hackathon hours?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>We donât think so. There will be separate awards for teams that present solutions built on their existing technologies, and for teams that start fresh at the hackathon. We want to honor all of you, regardless of whether you have been working for a while on something you are passionate about, or whether you decide on something brand new.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Do I have to work non-stop?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>No. The work space will be available non-stop entire durantion of the hackathon but it is up to you and your team to decide on your work schedule.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Will I be able to test my presentation before the final presentation?</span></div>
