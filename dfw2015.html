<p>Technology is a powerful tool that can help eradicate injustice, teach about God’s word, and strengthen the Church. What if you could be a part of building this kind of technology that can be used to change lives?</p>
<p>That is what Code for the Kingdom is all about. Partner with like-minded people who are changing lives by tackling real-world issues from a Christian perspective. </p>
<p>One common thing we hear from the Christian community is “But I’m not a (Programmer, Hacker, Visionary, Business Leader, Designer, Professional Genius, etc.) What would I have to offer?”</p>
<p>You are more talented than you’re giving yourself credit for! We all strive to live our lives in service to the Kingdom. This is your chance to live that out in a weekend of focused collaboration! Each person brings unique perspective, passion, and expertise to the table. When like-minded people come together, incredible things can happen. </p>
<p>Join us in March for a weekend hackathon at The Addison Treehouse in Addison, TX where you will be able to meet and work together with people who are serious about using technology to further the Kingdom.</p>

        </header>
        <p>Every person has something unique to contribute to the community, society, and church. Yet, less than 20% of us are actively engaged in doing what we could do. Most of us do not understand how we can leverage our skills and ideas to improve the lives of others.

What if we could discover how to use our unique gifts for God’s Kingdom? Build technologies to mobilize and equip every member of your community, church and family. Empower them to release their skills as well as to accelerate great ideas and initiatives that could transform the lives of the child or adult down your street.</p></section>

        <p>Every person has the right to receive God’s Word and discover His unconditional love, because only God’s truth has the ability to transform the heart and the mind. Join forces with other like minded individuals and create technologies that help reduce spiritual poverty in every nation, city, community, family, and individual.

Build mobile applications to help children learn the Word of God, bury it in their hearts and share it with their friends. Create technologies for prayer, evangelism, mentorship, and other innovative means to spiritual formation.

        <p>We are all called to a life of generous sacrifice extending beyond simple financial generosity, to include generosity of our mind, love, time and possessions. If the Kingdom of God is to truly to be advanced by us, we need to answer the call of generosity. It is only when we live out this radical generosity that the Church will be unleashed in thoughtfulness, action, and resources to advance the Kingdom of God in the world. Create technology to encourage individuals and families to become generous in every aspect of their lives.</p>

<blockquote>“To be loved but not known is comforting but superficial. To be known and not loved is our greatest fear. But to be fully known and truly loved is, well, a lot like being loved by God. It is what we need more than anything. It liberates us from pretense, humbles us out of our self-righteousness, and fortifies us for any difficulty life can throw at us.” - Timothy Keller</blockquote>

<p>Dallas has one of the most vibrant and active entrepreneurial communities in the country - not to mention being FULL of people who are serving the Lord through technology in their careers. A large part of the weekend will be dedicated to building relationships.</p>
<p>If you can’t attend the entire event then just come Friday night for our kickoff or Saturday morning when the hacking is in full swing. You will experience the Dallas tech community in action. Don’t be surprised if you end up staying through the weekend.</p>
<p><p>Register now to join us in Dallas/Fort Worth  as we work to leveraging technology to transforms lives. Plus, you get to rub shoulders with some of the most effective global ministries, technologists, entrepreneurs, investors, hi-tech accelerators, church leaders and creative individuals from every discipline.</p></p>

    <div class="content">
<p>A digital marketing campaign that uses a twitter connected app to virally disrupt posts that advertise human trafficking. Technology (in particular website, social networks, and mobile phones) has become the tools by which human traffickers recruit new victims and advertise to “johns”. They use those technologies to provide contact information.</p>
<p>&quot;#ihaveaname&quot; tells the trafficker: “You want to be contacted? You got it!!! The Crowd WILL contact you. &quot;#ihaveaname&quot; activates the crowd to send so much traffic to the trafficker’s point of contact, that such point of contact becomes ineffective for the trafficker to do business.</p>

    <div class="content">
<p>Raising money for mission trips is very challenging, especially for long term missionaries. Existing donors are often exhausted by constant donation requests. Imagine if you could raise money for missionaries the same way the Ice Bucket Challenge did for ALS. Building on top of an existing project, Clement and Fraser (2 out of 4 co-founders) continued to work on their startup, MultiplyMe - a crowdfunding platform for nonprofits such as churches and missionaries. Typical fundraising models focus on rallying existing donor audiences but MultiplyMe focuses on raising funds through existing donor audiences and their personal networks.</p>

      MentorMe

    <div class="content">
<p>Mentorship is crucial for engaging Christians cross-generationally. This App will focus on connecting a community of Christian women who are searching for someone to help them navigate through the struggles of life as well as those looking for an outlet to share wisdom and life experiences. 
The App will focus on finding connections in key metrics such as passions, life experiences and struggles. One key feature focuses on discretion during the early stages of matching. This allows women to find mentors who’ve walked through common struggles without infringing on their privacy. (i.e. miscarriages, sexual abuse, depression) Additional features will include curriculum offerings, engagement tools and process mapping.
All in all, this app is designed to unite women in the body of Christ to support and serve one another in the unique roles God has created them for.</p>

      How can technology for good be used to disrupt the technologies used by the human traffickers to conduct their business? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Technology has become the predominant tool of sex traffickers. The ease by which they can acquire mobile phones and new numbers, allows the traffickers to coordinate meeting points, terms of the transaction, and to maintain communication with the victims and the “johns”. Escort websites and online classified ad sites provide the traffickers with countless opportunities to conduct their businesses and publish those mobile numbers. But what if you were to create technology that would take the very same information traffickers advertise, and use it to direct so much traffic to their mobile phones to the point their main means of communication becomes useless? </p>

<p>Currently in the US alone, according to the national data (<a href="http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/converge/latestData/step2.asp"><a href="http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/converge/latestData/step2.asp">http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/converge/latestData/step2.asp</a></a>) by the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, there are over 120,000 people waiting for organ transplants and only about 14,000 donors. In addition, 82% of the waiting list is for kidneys. But what if the right technology at the hand of churches across the country could serve to educate, engage, and recruit Christians to give the gift of life and double the number of donors? </p>
<p>How can you affect the life of the person in your community who needs a new kidney, and his/her family? What if technology allowed the opportunity to become a donor to be present every time someone interacts with her/his church digital tools, instead of every few years during driver license renewal?</p>

      How can technology connect people searching for God online regardless of what OTT messaging service they use? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>We all understand that the best way to serve people is by meeting them where they are. Global Media Outreach is serving the millions of people each day that search on the Internet for a spiritual term. Tens of thousands (and growing) of Online Missionaries (OMs) are in place to respond to those asking for help via the Internet.  With Over-The-Top instant messaging services ( such as WhatsApp, Kik, and many others), becoming more and more the preferred means of communication when the person searching is concerned about SMS costs, OMs must have a unified way to be in contact with the people they serve, regardless of which OTT messaging apps each party is using.</p>

<p>By using audio recordings, The Bible is able to be translated, shared, and heard.  But this is a slow and time consuming process. Currently, symbols are created on paper to represent key thoughts in a specific order.  This helps the translator remember the verses they hear and retain them as they speak passages from memory.

    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Just South of Dallas, there is a large community of lower-income neighborhoods that meet the criteria for a “food desert”: an urban area in which it is difficult to buy affordable or good-quality fresh food. In these poverty-stricken areas, many single-parent children are left to purchase, prepare and feed their families as their parents work. This lack of access leads to child-obesity, illness, and much more. But what if technology could help people “love their neighbor” by activating a community to work together in acquiring, preparing, distributing, selling, and/or serving better food to the neighborhood?

<p>This Hackathon is a non-profit event to encourage the activation and on-going collaboration of a larger ecosystem of all sort of creative individuals ( including programmers, designers, creatives, entrepreneurs, and leaders of churches, non-profits, and the marketplace) who are passionate about creating technologies to tackle from a Christian perspective the challenges confronting our society, our communities, our churches, and our spiritual lives.</p>

  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Is there a main theme to the Code for the Kingdom Dallas/Fort Worth Hackathon?</span></div>
  <div class="content">

  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">What if I don’t know how to program?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Everyone has something to offer to help transform lives. If you come full of ideas there will be technologists eager to be in a team with you.</p>

  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">I can’t stay the entire time, can I still participate?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes. We realize that 47 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments, or might prefer to work remotely, or need to go home/hotel to rest and shower. Yet, you need to be present for the initial few hours during the startup demos, and at some point you need be at the venue and do some work onsite. You will also need to be present for the final few hours for the presentations and judging.</p>

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Will I meet my team members before the event?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Possibly. You can use the Code for the Kingdom Google + Community at anytime to meet other participants, propose ideas, and recruit or be recruited into a team. But you can also bring your own team, or come alone and become part of a team at the hackathon.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Can I present a technology I already have?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>You can build on top of something you have, but whatever you present must have new code developed for at least one of the challenges of the hackathon and you must do some of that coding at the hackathon venue during the hackathon hours.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Won’t other teams who are building on top of technologies they already developed, not have an unfair advantage over me who plans to start coding during the actual hackathon hours?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>We don’t think so. There will be separate awards for teams that present solutions built on their existing technologies, and for teams that start fresh at the hackathon. We want to honor all of you, regardless of whether you have been working for a while on something you are passionate about, or whether you decide on something brand new.</p>
