Code for the Kingdom is a weekend hackathon for techies, designers, and entrepreneurial starters. Using prayer and technology, we tackle from a Christian perspective the challenges confronting our society, our churches, and our spiritual lives. Technology alone is insufficient. Yet God can use it as a tool for good. The weekend of June 28-30, 2013 more than 100 technologists will converge in San Francisco to use technology to help Kingdom-minded initiatives flourish.</p>

        <p>The Church and non-profits are always significantly underfunded. The Great Commission could be tremendously impacted and enhanced if financial resources were available. What better opportunity than this to cultivate generosity with Generis? Build fresh user experiences that can help organizations redefine the giving experience for their patrons.

      How can technology bring the word of God to the mobile first generation of children?

<p>Did you know that more than 80% of Christians choose Christ between the ages of 4-14?  Children are the biggest mission field, and they have impressionable young minds that are fertile ground for the Word of God.</p>
<p>Build a mobile application to help children learn the word of God, bury it in their hearts and share it with their friends in a fun, interactive, and engaging way, using the platforms they&#39;re already using while making the Bible more &quot;awesome&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; than Angry Birds, Temple Run, and Candy Crush.</p>

    <h3>Engaging and releasing the best of an individual</h3> 
  </div>
  <div class="9u challenge-description">
    <div class="expander intro">
      <span class="toggle-switch"></span>
      How do we leverage technology within our local church and/or network of churches to release and accelerate great ideas from every member of the congregation? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>In too many churches the 80-20 rule is at work, where 80% of the congregation is only minimally engaged. In today’s world, most every person in a congregation has an educational or training specialty that could uniquely contribute to the life of their church. According to surveys, about 40% of a church’ membership cites the perception that their skills and ideas being undervalued by the church as the main limiting factor to their engagement. </p>
<p>But what if the church truly developed a mechanism by which every individual could act upon his/her God given call?</p>
<p>Imagine a Kingdom Crowd Innovation Platform, one that brings together the components of Open Innovation, Collective Knowledge, Collective Creativity, Community Building, Social Engagement, and Crowd Funding.</p>
<p>Imagine it as a local church platform by which any and every member of the congregation can pitch ideas to positively affect the church, the community, society, and the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Imagine other members evaluating those ideas, giving them thumbs or down, and supporting them with time, talent, or treasure.</p>
<p>Imagine allowing the larger community to engage with the local church in such way, giving the un-churched Kingdom purpose resulting in passion for Kingdom initiatives.</p>

    <h3>Generosity</h3> 
  </div>
  <div class="9u challenge-description">
    <div class="expander intro">
      <span class="toggle-switch"></span>
      Simpler and quicker to give with automated responses to givers 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Knowing that generosity brings about spiritual growth and that generosity is a like a muscle (the sooner they start exercising it the stronger the person will become), how do we radically shrink the amount of time it takes someone to become generous to a cause? </p>
<p>Giving and generosity systems in churches are set up mainly to appeal to the Boomer generation and older. As giving motivations changes, younger givers are not only looking at different reasons to give but also different methods to give. Churches are notorious for only promoting cash and checks in their weekly offerings. This will not work as we try to encourage church people (especially the younger generations) to become more generous to the church.</p>
<p>How do we make it very simple for people to give electronically? How can we develop easy to use giving mechanisms (mobile devices) that would be appealing and easy to use? And, after they give, how can we created automated responses based on their giving activity (amount of gift, frequency of gift, etc.). An additional feature would be automatically generated reports for the senior leadership team showing changes in giving activity – increase in regular giving, significant one-time gift, decrease in giving.</p>
<p>Additionally, givers are motived when they know their giving makes a difference. In other words, “How are lives changed when I give?” Stories of impact make a big difference. However, churches are challenged when it come to collecting the stories and telling them to their constituency. What if we could create a “generosity channel” in the church – a place where people would be encouraged to upload their stories. The church would need to have a curator to screen and organize the videos. People could subscribe to the channel. Alternately, the church could push the videos to people as they make contributions to the church.</p>
<p>Benefit:
Simple, economical online tools allow leaders to do what they do best, without worrying about the technical details of raising money. Providing a simple interface to encourage givers to start giving will advance generosity, especially with people who do not typically write checks to the church. Integrations with various church management systems will allow leaders to keep close contact with the givers.
and start raising money.</p>

    <h3>Crowdfunding</h3> 
  </div>
  <div class="9u challenge-description">
    <div class="expander intro">
      <span class="toggle-switch"></span>
      Crowd funding and synergy with other churches 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Communities have needs that are not funded. Churches do not typically come together to fund community needs. Many times, those churches would fund community type projects if they had the resources. The idea here is to unite multiple churches in a community and, at the same time, create a crowd funding mechanism to raise the resources. For example, an urban ministry has a legitimate need for $100,000. Churches do not pay attention because they know they do not have $100,000. What if we could unite 4-5 churches at $20,000 - $25,000 each and then use a crowd funding mechanism inside each church to raise the $100,000 total?</p>
<p>(Note: Though we have only mentioned community needs, this mechanism could be used to fund all kinds of needs – church plants and startup ministries, for example. Can we create an application that will grow with the needs of leaders, especially when they transition from &#39;startup&#39; to &#39;established&#39;? Users will be able to create instant giving sites, with TANGIBLE items pre-populated that we know new churches need (i.e. trailers, microphones, stage equip, insurance, etc.). Similar to Kickstarter, but context specific to meet known needs church leaders need, the system will automatically generate a giving micro site and give leaders full control over their own giving area.)</p>
<p>Benefit:
Simple, economical online tools allow leaders to do what they do best, without worrying about the technical details of raising money. Processing costs will be distributed across the community, so individual ministries are not bearing brunt of all those costs. Gives leaders a &#39;jumpstart&#39; on casting vision for tangible needs, because the system will pre-populate their giving area with common needs. Integrations with MailChimp, Social Media, etc, will allow leaders to quickly cast vision and start raising money.</p>

<p>Create technologies that would disrupt the business of sex trafficking, bring tools to the men, women, and organizations fighting sex trafficking globally, and bring hope and safe passage to the victims.</p>
<p>For example: </p>
<p>Build a mobile application that tourists and residents can use to alert suspicious activity in the area, with GPS, photo, time of day, video, audio, and text. Include tips to teach users to successfully identify suspicious activity. Perhaps even alert users of successful rescues in the area.</p>
<p>Build a web front-end that can be used to dispatch agents of sex trafficking fighting organizations to the locations, based on urgency, and accuracy of the information. Track when an agent decides to accept the location, their notes, as well as any subsequent trips to the location. Visualize all interactions using maps, timelines, photo albums to tag people, etc.</p>
<p>Build a mobile application for agents to intercept jobs near their location and record their own notes, photos, GPS, video, time of day, audio, and text. Rank urgency of rescue, and certainty of the crime. This must have the ability to go into silent or incognito mode once inside a facility, for the safety of the agents.</p>

    <h3>Prayer</h3>

  <div class="9u challenge-description">
    <div class="expander intro">
      <span class="toggle-switch"></span>
      How can we activate 21st century believers to pray more often, deep and informed? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Prayer is at the center of our relationship with God. It is our means of communication with Him, it strengthens us as believers and as community, and it is how we seek for what God wants for us to do. While food, water, and air sustain life, Prayer sustains our spiritual life.
As Christians we are asked to never stop praying. Yet, the busy lifestyle created by  the rapid diffusion of digital technologies like mobile phones, social networking sites, and the Internet is resulting in an ever busy lifestyle that  significantly distracts us away from Prayer.  But what if we could use the very same technologies to encourage a Prayer?</p>
<p>Build technologies that activate and grow the praying community relevant to me for my requests, praises and encouragement by providing a means to:</p>
<p>Mobilize prayer for my ministry,</p>
<p>Discover and respond to how God is moving in my praying community, my city and across the globe</p>
<p>notify affirmation, love, encouragement from a user’s praying community</p>

      <span class="toggle-switch"></span>
      How can technology help alleviate and/or combat the effects of fatherlessness in a child’s life, in turn strengthening families, reducing poverty and crime? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Fatherlessness is epidemic, affecting one out of every 4 children in the United States. According to the US Census and other data, fatherless children represent: 75% of adolescent patients in chemical abuse centers, 85% of youths in prisons, 63% of youth suicides, 90% of all homeless and runaway children, 85% of all children who show behavior disorders, 71% of all high school dropouts. Fatherless children are four times more likely to be poor, and at least twice as like to be involved in criminal activity.</p>
<p>What if technology could foster ways by which every fatherless family could receive love, opportunities, mentorship, support, kindness, healthy relationships, and genuine acceptance from others?</p>
