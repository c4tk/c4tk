<p>Join us for the 2016 Chicago Code for the Kingdom hackathon. Together with local organizers and partner organizations, we share a common vision to provide more opportunities for communities around the world to participate and showcase innovation and entrepreneurship in their communities. We unite to create technologies addressing significant issues confronting society, community, families, and spiritual life.</p>
<p>The first Chicago Code for the Kingdom hackahton builds upon the success of previous hackathons, which have already gathered over 3500 technologists who have created hundreds of projects to do good. This Chicago collaboration will leverage the skills and insights of our entrepreneurs, designers, and technologists to foster an entrepreneurial culture with Christian values and activate technologists to give their skills and some time as their contribution to the mission field.</p>
<p>Come, participate and address a number of challenges aimed at helping release the oppressed, teaching God’s Word, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and supporting the church and the body of Christ. </p>
<p>Join us and let’s together create technology that matters.</p>

  <div class="content">
<p>A hackathon is an event where people get together and develop some awesome technologies in a short time span. Think of it as a creative marathon where at the end you have some product to show for.</p>

  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Who is organizing the 2016 Chicago Code for the Kingdom Hackathon?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>It is being organized by Leadership Network in collaboration with an amazing group of local organizers in Chicago.</p>

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">What is this hackathon trying to accomplish?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>This Hackathon is a non-profit event to encourage the activation and on-going collaboration of a larger ecosystem of all sorts of creative individuals (including programmers, designers, creatives, entrepreneurs, and leaders of churches, non-profits, and the marketplace) who are passionate about creating technologies to tackle the challenges confronting our society, our communities, our churches, and our spiritual lives from a Christian perspective.</p>

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">I&#x27;m not Christian. Can I still participate?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">What if I don’t know how to program?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Everyone has something to offer to help transform lives. If you come full of ideas there will be technologists eager to be in a team with you.</p>

</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Do I have to bring my own laptop?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes; we do not provide computers. Please bring anything you’ll need to code.</p>

  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">I can’t stay the entire time, can I still participate?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes. We realize that 47 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments, or might prefer to work remotely, or need to go home/hotel to rest and shower. Yet, you need to be present for the initial few hours during the startup demos, and at some point you need be at the venue and do some work onsite. You will also need to be present for the final few hours for the presentations and judging.</p>

  </div>

</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Can I present a technology I already have?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>You can build on top of something you have, but whatever you present must have new code developed for at least one of the challenges of the hackathon and you must do some of that coding at the hackathon venue during the hackathon hours.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Won’t other teams who are building on top of technologies they already developed, not have an unfair advantage over me who plans to start coding during the actual hackathon hours?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>We don’t think so. There will be separate awards for teams that present solutions built on their existing technologies, and for teams that start fresh at the hackathon. We want to honor all of you, regardless of whether you have been working for a while on something you are passionate about, or whether you decide on something brand new.</p>

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Do I have to work non-stop?</span></div>

<p>No. The work space will be available non-stop entire durantion of the hackathon but it is up to you and your team to decide on your work schedule.</p>
