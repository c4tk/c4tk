Create for the Kingdom is a special Code for the Kingdom event in Austin, TX. It expands the weekend to include Filmmakers and Game Developers along with the traditional Hackathon-ers. During this weekend there will be a Game Jam, Film Challenge and Hackathon, each with prizes (check them out below). We encourage collaboration between all of the disciplines for the purposes of building a long-term ecosystem where global issues are tackled from a Creative Christian perspective, while welcoming the participations of individuals from all worldviews and faiths.</p>
<p>“How can all Creatives help alleviate and eradicate injustice, teach God’s unconditional love and build a healthier and stronger society?” That is the question we will answer at Create for the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Join us this September, to foster visionary creatives to create new mediums to transform lives through a holistic Christian approach that combats social injustice, creates a culture of generosity, facilitates spiritual justice and unleashes the fullest capacity of each individual.</p>
<p>The weekend event will focus the passion, purpose, and creativity of our entrepreneurial and creative community, connecting incredible innovators with organizations, and initiatives that need their talent.</p>
<p>Join us at Austin,TX as we battle the challenges confronting our communities, our society, our families, and our spiritual lives.</p>

          <h3>Help Create a culture of Generosity</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The Follower of Christ is called to a life of generous sacrifice extending beyond simple financial generosity, to include generosity of our mind, time and possessions. If the Kingdom of God is to truly to be advanced by us, we need to answer the call of radical generosity. It is only when we live out this radical generosity that the Church will be unleashed in thoughtfulness, action, and resources to advance the Kingdom of God in the world. Create technology, films, and games to encourage individuals and families to become generous in every aspect of their lives.

        </header>
        <p>Every person has something unique to contribute to the community, society, and church. Yet, most of us do not understand how we can leverage our skills and ideas to improve the lives of others.

What if we could discover how to use our unique gifts for God’s Kingdom? Use technology, films, or games to mobilize and equip every member of your community, church and family. Empower them to release their skills as well as to accelerate great ideas and initiatives that could transform the lives of the child or adult down your street.

<p>Our skills are not sufficient to tackle the challenges our society faces. We know the first step must be prayer. As David took down Goliath with the power of God, so we need this same guidance. Thus, for every hour of this event we&#39;re asking people from across the Austin area, and the participants to take some time out, and join us in prayer in a 47 hour prayer room onsite at the event venue.<br><br/></p>

    <h3>Know and Love your neighbor</h3>

      <span class="toggle-switch"></span>
      How can we leverage technology, films, or games to cultivate and strengthen one of society&#x27;s most foundational relationships - neighbors, and ultimately build a healthier and stronger community? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Jesus commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves. But how many of your actual neighbors do you know? How can we expect our communities to flourish when we don’t even know the people living within a few hundred yards from us? How can you love someone if you don’t understand who they are, what they value, their strengths, and the challenges they face? It is easy to be unaware of the needs of others, when we don’t know them. But what a difference could we make in our community if we were intentional at loving our actual neighbors. How much safer, how much healthier would the environment in which children grow be if neighbors knew and loved each other?</p>
<p>How can geo-mapping technology be used in apps/sites to encourage, organize, and promote neighborhood activities led by Christians in the community, fostering a neighborhood movement? How can such technology make us aware of our neighbors’ needs and mobilize our neighborhood to meet those needs? How can technology help us know and love each other?</p>
<p>How can films change the paradigm of what being a neighbor means, inspiring us to know and love our neighbor?</p>
<p>How can games teach children and young people why being a good neighbor is important, how to go from tolerance to grace, the skills for conflict resolution, the value of granting and receiving forgiveness, and how to live a life committed to making things better? <div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/dWqIcZIL6dA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>

    <h3>Foster Families</h3> 
  </div>
  <div class="9u challenge-description">
    <div class="expander intro">
      <span class="toggle-switch"></span>
      How can we leverage technology, films, or games to help provide a loving home for every child? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Foster parents face difficult challenges on a daily basis. Children in foster care often come from traumatic experiences, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. On top of dealing with the trauma, gaining  trust, providing at home health care, helping with the education and the recovery of the child, foster parents have to deal with  bureaucratic, underfunded, understaffed, and antiquated legal and social services systems. From having to deal with multiple social workers due to the workers’ high turnover rate, to having to deal with cumbersome State reporting requirements, the administrative tasks of foster parents are very burdensome. </p>
<p>By helping unburden foster parents from some time wasting processes forced upon them by the foster system, you could improve their lives and free them to give greater focus to the needs of their family, improving the chances of the foster child to adjust, recover, and grow healthier in a loving family. By doing this you could help remove some of the barriers that prevent good people from becoming foster parents. </p>
<p>Create apps to help reduce the burden and stress on foster parents by making it easier to meet the tracking and reporting requirements of the state.</p>
<p>Create films to bring awareness to the plight of children in the foster care system while recruiting and encouraging foster and adoptive families.</p>
<p>Create games to help foster children in your community overcome trauma, and develop stronger bonds and trust with other members of their foster families</p>

    <h3>Human Trafficking</h3> 
  </div>
  <div class="9u challenge-description">
    <div class="expander intro">
      <span class="toggle-switch"></span>
      How can technology and films activate every local church to take an intentional and active role in combating human trafficking? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Even if all the initiatives that fight human trafficking were to work as one, that would not be enough to provide for the rescue, transition, and on-going recovery needs of the large majority of victims of human trafficking worldwide.   Only The Church has enough geographical reach, members, and resources to augment the work of the anti human trafficking organizations and meet the victims’ needs when they need them, where they need them, and how they need them. </p>
<p>Imagine the moment when victims of human trafficking are finally escaping their oppressors. Anti-human trafficking case workers might be helping them, but do not have a place for the victims to hide and sleep today, and perhaps a different place tomorrow, and a different place the day  after, as victims must be moved from safe place to safe place until they are truly out of the reach of their victimizers. The victims only have the clothes on their back, and they need clotting now.  They are traumatized and they need mental health care further than the case workers can provide. Maybe they do not speak the local language and need a translator. They need food. They have many urgent needs that cannot wait. But their needs are not limited to urgent needs. Transitional needs including health care, child care, substance abuse treatment, housing, education, and job training and placement are so many that anti-human trafficking organizations are unable to effectively provide by themselves. The ongoing recovery needs require true transformation that can only take place through Christ and The Church. </p>
<p>How can technology help provide the bridge to a transformed life where every stone of that bridge is a local church connected by the work of anti-human trafficking organizations? What if technology allowed the creation of a global and local resource network that would enable every local church to have a pool of resources (food, housing, money, health care, clothes, training, etc) readily available so anti-human trafficking organizations can tap into those resources when, where, and how victims need them? Ask why churches do not have such readily available resources, and change that.</p>
<p>How can films activate in each of us, as well as The Church, the calling to fight human trafficking and partner with others to provide for the victim in your own community?</p>

      How can we ensure environmental sustainability in our local and global community? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>We are called to protect our environment and the beauty of nature reflects God’s love. The Pope recently stated that environmental degradation “is one of the biggest challenges we have,” and posed the question “Isn’t humanity committing suicide with this indiscriminate and tyrannical use of nature?” How can we inspire and enable Austin, as well as the global community, to preserve our environment?</p>

      How can you help enable a relational dialog about the Gospel with the 2 Billion Muslims globally? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>How can you help Muslims learn about Christ? While many Muslims are interested in learning more about Christ, most of them do not want their family and friends to know. Fear of others and security are very real issues to a Muslim engaging the Gospel. However, being a very relational culture, Muslims make decisions in the context of community.</p>
<p>How can technology, films, and games help Muslims engage with the Gospel in the context of community, while protecting their identity for security?</p>
<p>How can you help the 13 million ethnic Christians in the Middle East reach their Muslim neighbors? How can you encourage them, disciple them, and help them reach their own nations?</p>

      How can we enable and inspire youth to be radically generous? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Too long the church has focused on a narrow view of generosity dealing solely on the financial giving of adults, and forgotten to teach a holistic view of generosity (generosity of thoughts, time and stuff). Not only this, but the culture of youth and teens is very different than Baby Boomers, who the church has traditionally turned to for support. With the future of the church at stake, how can we properly instill a holistic view of radical generosity in youths and teens by being generous in their thoughts, time, and with their stuff (money included). </p>
<p>How can games inspire and teach youth to be generous with thoughts, time and resources?</p>
<p>How can film inspire a culture of generosity?</p>
<p>How can an app help us live a life of true fasting as proclaimed in Isaiah 58:6-12?</p>

    A civic minded business woman I have been working to support the video game business ecosystem, and do so through my work on Captivate and the Texas Creative Incubator. These two initiatives have a healthy relationship with each other and I am currently working to develop both in tandem with several awesome people.
<br>
This all started when I tried to start my own venture and found little resources available for a fledgling start-up. After looking at the industry as a whole I realized there was a project there, rolled up my sleeves and got started. Now we are at the stage where things are taking shape, with an Incubator spinning up quickly to support creative industries and a conference to captivate professionals, entrepreneurs and educators.
<br>
My traditional background is an Executive Producer who has worked on a wide variety of titles, platforms and teams. I have worked well with executives, directors and leads to organize and manage the schedule, keep on budget and satisfy the needs of each individual team member. I possess a strong ability to develop and grow relationships with business partners. My goal is to leverage this background to smooth the communications between start-ups and investors, providing both groups with the support and information they need to be successful.
<br>
As the Chapter Chair of IGDA-Austin I have enjoyed building community, developing events and providing support to our local government as a representative of the gaming industry. My goal is to continue to expand the services that IGDA-Austin provides and continue to improve our community.

As a result, Kevin is known worldwide for his work in establishing entrepreneur networks in the U.S., Mexico, Chile, Singapore and Korea.
<br>
His distinguished career fuels his passion for advising startups, which has seen two $0-to-$1 million startups and four others that made the $500,000 mark, and a number of �firsts� including the development of the first internet banking application in 1995 and the first large-scale e-commerce application engine, which generated over $2 billion in revenue for Dell Computer in the late 1990s. Kevin was at the forefront of exploring profile-driven commerce, the use of Linux to secure networks and exploring the feasibility of Affective Computing. And, his experience working with technology luminary Steve Jobs at NeXT influences his ability to inspire the global entrepreneurs he supports.
<br>

  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">I can’t stay the entire 47 hours, can I still participate?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes. We realize that 47 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments, or might prefer to work remotely, or need to go home/hotel to rest and shower. Yet, you should be present for the initial few hours of the kickoff, and at some point you need be at the venue and do some work onsite. You will also need to be present for the final few hours for the project presentations and judging.</p>

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Will I meet my team members before the event?</span></div>
  <div class="content">

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Can I present a technology, film, or game I already have?</span></div>

<p>You can build on top of something you have, but whatever you present must be in alignment with the event theme and have something new created for at least one of the challenges or projects of the event and you must do some of that work at the venue during the event hours.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Won’t other teams who are building on top of their existing works, have an unfair advantage over me who plans to start creating during the actual event hours?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>We don’t think so. There will be separate prizes, but of similar amount, for teams that present projects built on their existing works, and for teams that start fresh at the event. We want to honor all of you, regardless of whether you have been working for a while on something you are passionate about, or whether you decide on something brand new.</p>

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Do I have to work non-stop?</span></div>
