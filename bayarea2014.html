How can technology help alleviate and eradicate all forms of injustices, teach about God’s unconditional love, and build a healthier and stronger society?</p>
<p>This May, we want to develop new technologies to transform lives through a holistic Christian approach that combats social injustice, creates a culture of generosity, facilitates spiritual justice and unleashes the fullest capacity of each individual.</p>
<p>Code for the Kingdom is a weekend Hackathon where global issues are tackled with a Christian perspective. Join us at Redwood City, CA as we battle the challenges confronting people all over the world.</p>

        </header>
        <p>Every person has something unique to contribute to the community, society, and church. Yet, less than 20% of us are actively engaged in doing what we could do. Most of us do not understand how we can leverage our skills and ideas to improve the lives of others.

What if we could discover how to use our unique gifts for God’s Kingdom? Build technologies to mobilize and equip every member of your community, church and family. Empower them to release their skills as well as to accelerate great ideas and initiatives that could transform the lives of the child or adult down your street.</p></section>

        </header>
        <p>Every person has the right to receive God’s Word and discover His unconditional love, because only God’s truth has the ability to transform the heart and the mind. Join forces with other like minded individuals and create technologies that help reduce spiritual poverty in every nation, city, community, family, and individual.

Build mobile applications to help children learn the Word of God, bury it in their hearts and share it with their friends. Create technologies for prayer, evangelism, mentorship, and other innovative means to spiritual formation.

        <p>The Church and non-profits are always significantly underfunded. The Great Commission could be tremendously impacted and enhanced if financial resources were available. What better opportunity than this to cultivate generosity with Generis? Build fresh user experiences that can help organizations redefine the giving experience for their patrons.  Leverage the power of technology to encourage individuals and families to become generous to the causes and churches.

<p>Reaching the minority percentage with a Gospel they understand. 93% of the world can be reached by a mobile phone. The majority of those users have a smartphone. But what about those who have yet to get a smartphone? That’s where Faith Comes By Phone comes in. It is a call-back service that allows for scriptures to be sent to people by phone. Since incoming calls are free in most countries, Faith Comes By Phone, gives users a code that that “call in”. After the initial call is made with that code, the user receives an incoming call that begins speaking scripture in that person’s native language. </p>

      How can technology help alleviate and/or combat the effects of fatherlessness in a child’s life, in turn strengthening families, reducing poverty and crime? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Fatherlessness is epidemic, affecting one out of every 4 children in the United States. According to the US Census and other data, fatherless children represent: 75% of adolescent patients in chemical abuse centers, 85% of youths in prisons, 63% of youth suicides, 90% of all homeless and runaway children, 85% of all children who show behavior disorders, 71% of all high school dropouts. Fatherless children are four times more likely to be poor, and at least twice as like to be involved in criminal activity.</p>
<p>What if technology could foster ways by which every fatherless family could receive love, opportunities, mentorship, support, kindness, healthy relationships, and genuine acceptance from others?</p>

      What if there was a way for individuals to carry a digital “volunteer record” that would allow ministry leaders to see their background checks, gifts, skills, endorsements, past ministry and volunteering experience, etc, fast tracking their involvement in ministry? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Because of the transient nature of our culture, churches have many new members walking through their doors each year. Many of these members have experience and expertise in volunteer ministry that is often left idle due to complicated approval processes, poor follow up, and an overall lack of information sharing.</p>
<p>A Digital Volunteer Record could not only shorten the on-boarding time and simplify the process required to engage new members in ministry, but it could also cut down on a lot of duplicate administrative work that is often done in large churches where the same information needs to be collected and shared across multiple ministries. This Electronic Record would not be limited to church activities but it could be used for all type of volunteerism.</p>

      How can technology promote worldwide biblical literacy? How can technology help people with limited reading skills to understand and engage the Bible? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>50% of the world is illiterate and will never be reached with the printed page. And yet, every person has the right to receive God’s Word in their own language because, only God’s truth has the ability to transform the heart and the mind.</p>
<p>Even among the literate, biblical content in their heart language may be scarce and even in languages where there is an abundance of content, many people are not biblically literate.</p>
<p>How can technology promote worldwide biblical literacy? How can technology help people with limited reading skills to understand and engage the Bible?</p>
<p>There is such a thing as “heart language.” These are the thoughts in your head, the phrases you naturally repeat, the songs that make their way from your lips into your psyche. Most of these are first heard with our ears and repeated with our lips.</p>
<p>For the first time in history the Bible in text, audio and video has now been normalized and made available via APIs so YOU can reach 5.7 billion people in over 800 languages. Through the Digital Bible Platform you can integrate the Bible in all of your most effective digital evangelism, discipleship and engagement tools? Faith Comes By Hearing is looking for the most creative ways to apply this platform to reach the World! And they want to support you all the way to accomplish this.</p>
<p>What if people around the world could remember the whole counsel of God in their heart language? Can believers have the promises, reasoning, implications, songs and stories of Scripture readily available in their hearts and minds instead of simply on their smartphones or bookshelves?</p>
<p>Can we build oral translation technology to help multilingual churches thrive and promote the witness of a united church that spans language and cultural barriers?</p>
<p>Can we invent tools that empower people to create multilingual video and audio content that engages people who are not proficient readers with the Scriptures?</p>

      How can a mobile game disrupt the mindsets of atheism, postmodernism and secularism among youth today? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>Research OneHope conducted in Europe this year showed that a startlingly high percentage of youth were entirely disinterested in God, discussing Him, learning more, or reading material concerning God; it was all completely out of the question for them. In an environment like that, we cannot start with the Bible, or even a contextualized version of the Gospel. Instead, we need a game for a secular audience that is fun, challenging, and subtly brings users to reexamine their own presuppositions about the world, open the door and spark a curiosity that could lead to a willingness to listen to what the Bible has to say.</p>
<p>Even if all you build is a framework, or a concept or an intro video or a single level that can be developed further, that would be a great start in only 48 hours.</p>

      Can you create technology that would foster a new Good Samaritan personal ethos, in which each and every one of us would have the tools to see, hear, report, and help met the spiritual and physical needs of others? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>There are initiatives and technologies empowering churches and non-profits to help meet the needs of people in their communities. But what if instead of thousands of churches and non-profits taking the lead, it was millions of individuals all over the world doing so as part of their lifestyle? Imagine how many more people would be served and lifted.</p>
<p>How many times have some many of us walked by the Tenderloin district not really seeing the ones in need. Whether you are volunteer or not, you could record the need, pinpoint the location, report it to local charities like San Francisco City Impact, and collaborate with SFCI to activate your friends, and any individual and any organization that can help meet the need of that individual. Whether it is a prayer request, a pair of glasses, warm clothes, housing, or any other need, the ability to set change in motion would switch to each one of us. </p>

      Can you create beautiful visual storytelling technology to help pre-literate or illiterate children engage with the Bible and easily share with friends? 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
<p>One of OneHope’s most successful ways of spreading the Gospel is through their 17 Stories curriculum. They reach hundreds of thousands of children all over the world each year through this set of 16 trading cards that capture the metanarrative of the Bible. Children receive one card each week they attend, and when all the cards are assembled in the right order, the backs of the cards create one whole image that shows how the children are included and a part of the whole story of the Bible. This program has proved highly successful in attracting children to return to local church programming on a regular basis, and is also effective in outreach to pre-literate audiences.</p>
<p>Do not feel constrained to attempt to duplicate the experience with these physical cards. Rather, use what One Hope has created as a starting point and explore new ways that these cards, images and stories could be used in a mobile digital context to reach children.</p>

<p>Small Groups help us nurture our faith, and build stronger relationships.

Yet, as small groups grow the need for structure during the meeting also grows, so all can be heard and the meeting kept on track.</p>
<p>What if there was a Small Group Facilitation app that would help the Small Groups Leaders and Participants, as well as Church leadership, plan, execute and stay on track with the purpose and design for the particular group?</p>

  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">What&#x27;s a hackathon?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>A hackathon is an event where people get together and develop some awesome technologies in a short time span. Think of it as a creative marathon where at the end you have some product to show for.</p>

  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Who is organizing the 2014 Code for the Kingdom Bay Area Hackathon?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>The Code for the Kingdom Bay Area Hackathon is being organized by Leadership Network with the collaboration of Carpenters, The SF Bay Christian Entrepreneurs Meetup Group, and CrazyLove.org.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">What is this hackathon trying to accomplish?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>This Hackathon is a non-profit event to encourage the activation and on-going collaboration of a larger ecosystem of all sort of creative individuals ( including programmers, designers, creatives, entrepreneurs, and leaders of churches, non-profits, and the marketplace) who are passionate about creating technologies to tackle from a Christian perspective the challenges confronting our society, our communities, our churches, and our spiritual lives.</p>

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Is there a main theme to the Code for the Kingdom Bay Area Hackathon?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes, Transforming Lives. How can technology help alleviate and eradicate all forms of injustice while teaching about God’s unconditional love?</p>

  </div>

</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">I&#x27;m from outside the Bay Area. Can I still participate?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes. Join us.</p>

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">I&#x27;m not Christian. Can I still participate?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>

  </div>

</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">What if I don’t know how to program?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Everyone has something to offer to help transform lives. If you come full of ideas there will be technologists eager to be in a team with you.</p>

  </div>

</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Do I have to bring my own laptop?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes; we do not provide computers. Please bring anything you’ll need to code.</p>

</div>


  <div class="qa">

  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">I can’t stay whole 24 hours, can I still participate?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes. We realize that 47 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments, or might prefer to work remotely, or need to go home/hotel to rest and shower. Yet, you need to be present for the initial few hours during the startup demos, and at some point you need be at the venue and do some work onsite. You will also need to be present for the final few hours for the presentations and judging.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Can I sleep at the venue?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Yes the venue will be open for the duration of the event, please bring a sleeping bag, a pillow, or whatever you might need, and find a place at the venue to take a good nap.</p>

  </div>

</div>


  <div class="qa">

<p>Yes.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Will I meet my team members before the event?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Possibly. You can use the Code for the Kingdom Google + Community at anytime to meet other participants, propose ideas, and recruit or be recruited into a team. But you can also bring your own team, or come alone and become part of a team at the hackathon.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Can I present a technology I already have?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>You can build on top of something you have, but whatever you present must have new code developed for at least one of the challenges of the hackathon and you must do some of that coding at the hackathon venue during the hackathon hours.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Won’t other teams who are building on top of technologies they already developed, not have an unfair advantage over me who plans to start coding during the actual hackathon hours?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>We don’t think so. There will be separate prizes, but of similar amount, for teams that present solutions built on their existing technologies, and for teams that start fresh at the hackathon. We want to honor all of you, regardless of whether you have been working for a while on something you are passionate about, or whether you decide on something brand new.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Do I have to work non-stop?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>No. The work space will be available non-stop ( the entire hackathon 47 ) but it is up to you and your team to decide on your work schedule.</p>

  </div>
  <hr/>
</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Who owns the IP of what we make?</span></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>This is ultimately a question for your team. But neither the organizers nor Code for the Kingdom claims any ownership of any technologies you develop.</p>

  </div>

</div>


  <div class="qa">
  <div class="expander"><span class="toggle-switch"></span><span class="question">Will I be able to test my presentation before the final presentation?</span></div>
